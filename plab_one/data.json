With unopposed  plantarflexion, their foot drops.  \n \nThere are two main reasons why the deep fibular nerve could be compressed.  \n\u2022 The first is that the anterior leg muscles have been excessively used and so are \ncompressing the nerve with the anterior compartment.  The patient will experience \npain in the anterior leg.   \n\u2022 The other common cause is tight -fitting shoes, compressing the ne rve beneath the \nextensor retinaculum.

			"explanation": "Hand weakness involves either median nerve which has contributions from C5 -T1 or \nulnar nerve which originates from the C8 -T1 nerve roots.  \n \nRemember, a C8 vertebrae does not exist and so the option for C8/T1 is clearly wr ong.  \nThere are seven cervical vertebrae (C1 -C7) and a total of eight cervical nerves C1 -C8.  \nAll cervical nerves except C8 emerge above their corresponding vertebrae, while the C8 \nnerve emerges below the C7 vertebra that is between C7 and T1 vertebrae.  \n \nWhen you request for a cervical X -ray for any severe injury of the neck, you would like \nthe film to extend up to C7/T1 as you would be able to see the cervical vertebrae (C1 -\nC7). This applies for any trauma including road traffic accidents.  \n \nThe patient sho uld not try to move her neck and she should continue to have the \ncervical collar and immobilization of the neck until the cervical X -ray is performed to rule \nout cervical fractures.  \n \nIn this case, there should be at least 3 X -ray views taken.  \n\u2022 AP cervical spine view which shows the pedicles, facets and lateral masses  \n\u2022 Lateral cervical spine view  \n\u2022 Open -mouth odontoid view also called the peg view as would demonstrate peg \nfractures  \n \nIn some cases where the patient\u2019s neck is short, the X -ray film would not show the \nC7/T1 junction.  The radiographsers would then ask for a swimmers lateral view.  This \ninvolves repositioning the patient in such a way that the arm closest to the sensor is \nplaced above the patient\u2019s head much like a swimming position.

Paraesthesiae and pain can also \noccur along the affected nerve.  \n \nThe cervical spine is comprised of seven vertebrae only.  A C8 vertebral injury is \nphysically impossible and hence  cannot be the right answer.

			"question": "A 74 year old man started having chest pain.  He has a blood pressure of 70/50 mmHg.  His level \nof consciousness is decreased.  A radial pulse is felt.  An ECG shows the following rhythm.  What \nis the SINGLE most appropriate management?  \n \nhttps://t.me/afkebooks \n \nANSWER:  \nCardioversion  \n \nEXPLANATION:  \nFor junior doctors, the ECG pattern between ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation can be \nrather hard to distinguish. But here as the patient is still conscious, it cannot be ventricular fibrillation as v. \nfib would present without a pulse and the patient would not be conscious. Thus, ventricular tachycardia is \nthe answer here.  \n \nSince the patient is haemodynamically unstable, cardioversion would be the answer.  \n \nVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA:  \nVentricular tachycardia may impair cardiac output with consequent hypotension, collapse, and acute \ncardiac failure . This is due to extreme heart rates and lack of coordinated atrial contraction (loss of \u201catrial \nkick\u201d).  \n \nThe rate of V. Tach is from about 100 -250 bpm. P Waves may be present or absent. P waves are usually \nnot seen if the rate is increased. If present, th e P Waves have no relation to the QRS complexes of the V. \nTach.  \n \nV. tach can present in two ways:  \n \n1. With Pulse  \nHaemodynamically stable or  \nHaemodynamically unstable \u2014 e.g hypotension, chest pain, cardiac failure, decreased conscious level.  \n \n2. Without Pul se \n \nManagement depends on how the patient presents:  \nWith Pulse:  \nHaemodynamically stable \u2192 antiarrhythmics e.g. amiodarone, lidocaine, procainamide  \nHaemodynamically unstable \u2014 e.g hypotension, chest pain, cardiac failure, decreased conscious level. \n\u2192 immediate electrical cardioversion is indicated  \n \nWithout Pulse \u2192 immediate electrical cardioversion is indicated  \n \nECG ARRHYTHMIA CLINCHERS  \n \nCLINCHERS ONLY TO BE USED FOR EXAM PURPOSES  \nhttps://afkebooks.comThese clinchers help point you towards an answer but you would still need to read the whole stem and \nlook at the ECG before making up your mind.

It is defined as an \nischaemic stroke with symptoms that last for more than 24 hours but later resolve, \nleaving no permanent disability.  The reason this is important is often anticoagulation treatment is deferred for at least 14 days from onset in people with disabling ischaemic \nstroke for a fer of a haemorrhagic event.  In the interim aspirin 300 mg daily will be \nused.  \n \nFor non -disabling ischaemic st rokes, it depends on specific circumstances.  \nNonetheless, in this question they are asking for a long term prophylactic regimen and \nthus warfarin is still the best option whether it started in 14 days time or right away.  \n \nHe has atrial fibrillation which could lead to another stroke which is the reason that \nanticoagulation is extremely important.  If atrial fibrillation was not included in this \nquestion, then the answer would be aspirin for 2 weeks and clopidogrel long term for \nstroke prevention.  \n \nNICE upd ated their guidelines on the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in 2014.  \nThey suggest using the CHA 2DS2-VASc score to determine the most appropriate \nanticoagulation strategy.  This scoring system superseded the CHADS 2 score.  \n \nAs this patient has had a  stroke and his age is between 65 -74 years, this gives him a \nCHA 2DS2-VASc score of 3.  In general, we offer anticoagulation if the CHA 2DS2-VASc \nscore is 2 or more."

			"question": "A 10 year old boy is rushed to Accident & Emergency after his parents found him \nunconscious on the kitchen floor.  It is revealed that he ingested some \nmedication belonging to his grandmother.  His grandmother was unable to \nidentify which medications are missing.  On examination, the child is hypotensive \nwith dilated pupils and drynes s in the mouth.  His ECG showed prolongation of \nthe PR, QRS, and QT intervals.  Which SINGLE most likely medication has he \ntaken in excess?",
			"a": "Amitriptyline",
			"b": "Carbamazepine",
			"c": "Digoxin",
			"d": "Metoprolol",
			"e": "Thiazide",
			"answer": "Amitriptyline",
			"explanation": "The key to this question is trying to figure out what medication this child has taken and \ntry to tie it in with his signs and symptoms  \n \nAmitriptyline:  causs drowsiness, hypothermia, hypotension, tachycardia, dry mouth, \nECG shows arrhythmias, particularly changes in the QR S width, dilated pupils  \n \nCarbamazepine:   causes mydriasis and nystagmus, tachycardia, hypotension  \n \nDigoxin:   The classic features of digoxin toxicity are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, \nabdominal pain, headache, dizziness, confusion, delirium, vision disturban ce (blurred or \nyellow vision).  It is also associated with cardiac disturbances including irregular \nheartbeat, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, sinoatrial block and AV block  \n \nMetoprolol:  bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, hypoglycaemi a (especially in \nchildren) and seizures.  Myocardial conduction delays with decreased contractility typify \nthe acute beta -blocker ingestion.  \n \nThiazide: hypotension, fever, frequent urination, hypotension, muscle cramps and \ntwitching  \n \nThe two best contender es are amitriptyline and carbamazepine.  However, the single \nbest choice would be Amitriptyline because of the ECG changes.  \n \nTRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANT (TCA) OVERDOSE  \nTricyclic antedepressant (TCA) overdose should always be considered potentially life-\nthreatening.  They can deteriorate very rapidly sometimes within 1 hours of ingestion.  \n \nClinical features  \n\u2022 Dilated pupils  \n\u2022 Dry mouth  \n\u2022 Dry flushed skin  \n\u2022 Urinary retention  \n\u2022 Drowsiness and altered mental state leading to coma  \n\u2022 Hypotension  \n \nECG monitoring for TCA overdose is essential.  The important ECG finding suggestive \nof TCA poisoning is QRS widening (>100 ms).  Broad complex tachycardias may occur \nwhich are life threatening.  \n \nTwo popular stems in the exam where the answer is likely to be TC A overdose is the \nyoung child that takes his/her grandparents medication who later becomes drowsy and \nlethargic. Another is an elderly person who has a terminal illness and wants to take \nhis/her own life who comes in the ED having dry and flushed and pupil s are dilated.  TCA\u2019s are a prescription only medication andso you should think about how the person \nin the stem obtained the medication before you choose an answer."

			"d": "Intubate and provide IPPV on 100% oxygen",
			"e": "Refer to specialist unit",
			"answer": "Intubate and provide IPPV on 100% oxygen",
			"explanation": "As this patient is unconscious, we need to intubate and provide IPPV on 100% O2.  For \na conscious patient use a tight -fitting mask with an O2 reservoir.  \n \nThe decision for hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a difficult one and there are \nmany debates about the added value provided by hyperbaric oxygen. As this patient is \nunconscious, one might suggest a transfer to a hyperbaric ch amber but even so, this \nwill take time as you would need to call the Poisons Information Service and find the nearest locations of hyperbaric chambers.  In the current NICE guidelines, treatment \nwith hyperbaric oxygen is not currently recommended, because there is insufficient \nevidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves long -term outcomes of people with \nsevere carbon monoxide poisoning, compared with standard oxygen therapy. Thus, \nbased on NICE guidelines, for any question in PLAB with CO2 poisoning, h yperbaric \noxygen therapy will NOT be the answer.  \n \nIf this question was rewritten and asked for \u201cWhat is the SINGLE most appropriate \nINITIAL  management?, then mask with 100% oxygen would be a valid answer because \none would give 100% oxygen by mask first while preparing for intubation.  \n \nCARBON MONOXIDE POISONING  \nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a tasteless and odourless gas produced by incomplete \ncombus tion. Poisoning may occur from car exhausts, fires and faulty gas heaters. CO is \nalso produced by metabolism of methylene chloride (used in paint strippers and as an \nindustrial solvent).  \n \nCO decreases the oxygen -carrying capacity of the blood by binding ha emoglobin (Hb) \nto form carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb). This impairs O2 delivery from blood to the tissues \nthus causing severe tissue hypoxia.  \n \nClinical features:  \nEarly features are:  \n\u2022 Headache  \n\u2022 Malaise  \n\u2022 Nausea and vomiting  \n \nIn severe toxicity:  \n\u2022 'Pink' skin and mucos ae \n\u2022 Hyperpyrexia  \n\u2022 Arrhythmias  \n\u2022 Coma with hyperventilation  \n \nManagement  \nNote: The elimination half -life of CO is about 4 hours on breathing air, 1 hour on 100% \nO2, and 23 minutes on O2 at 3 atmospheres pressure.  \n\u2022 Clear the airway  \n\u2022 Maintain ventilation with high c oncentration of O2  \n\u2022 For a conscious patient use a tight -fitting mask with an O2 reservoir, but if \nunconscious intubates and provide IPPV on 100% O2  \n \nIndications for hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT):  \nThere is debate about the added value provided by hyperbaric oxygen. Hyperbaric O2 \ntherapy is logical, but of no proven benefit for CO poisoning. Transfer to a hyperbaric \nchamber and pressurization may take hours and so hyperbaric treatment may be no \nmore effective than ventilation on 100 % normobaric O2. Caring for a critically ill patient in a small pressure chamber may be impracticable.  \n \nA COHb concentration of >20% should be an indication to CONSIDER hyperbaric \noxygen and the decision should be taken on  the basis of the indicators listed below:  \n\u2022 Loss of consciousness at any stage  \n\u2022 Neurological signs other than headache  \n\u2022 Myocardial ischaemia/arrhythmia diagnosed by ECG  \n\u2022 The patient is pregnant.  \n \nIf there are any of the indications stated above, discuss with a  Poisons Information \nService and consider hyperbaric treatment. The Poisons Information Service can advise \non the location of hyperbaric chambers. But note currently, the treatment with \nhyperbaric oxygen is not currently recommended by NICE guidelines, bec ause there is \ninsufficient evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves long - term outcomes of \npeople with severe carbon monoxide poisoning, compared with standard oxygen \ntherapy."

			"b": "Reactionary haemorrhage",
			"c": "Secondary haemorrhage",
			"d": "Thyroid storm",
			"e": "Tracheomalacia",
			"answer": "Reactionary haemorrhage",
			"explanation": "Reactionary Haemorrhage occurs within the first 24 hours following trauma/surgery and \nit is usually caused by slipping of ligatures, dislodgement of clots, patient warming up \nafter surgery, causing vasodilation, on top of normalization of bloo d pressure.  \nHaemostasis appears secure until blood pressure rises to normal then bleeding begins.  \nTreatment usually involves replacing blood and re -exploring the wound.  \n \nHypotension, tense neck and blood oozing from drain tells us that the patient is probably bleeding.  As the patient is still in recovery room, it is likely that the surgery is \nrecent (less than 24 hours) thus the diagnosis of reactionary haemorrhage.  \n \nThe other options given are less likely  \n \nPrimary haemorrhage  \u2192 Occurs at the time of sur gery.  It is due to inadequate \nhaemostasis at the time of surgery or the displacement of a tie from the inferior pedicle.  \nTreatment involves replacing blood.  If severe, return to theatre for adequate \nhaemostasis.   \n \nSecondary haemorrhage  \u2192 Usually caused  by necrosis of an area of blood vessel, \nrelated to previous repair anjd is often precipitated by wound infection.  It occurs 1 to 2 \nweeks post -op.   \n \nThyroid storm  \u2192 is an extreme form of thyrotoxicosis.  This is an endocrine \nemergency.  It is precipitate d by stress, infection, surgery, or trauma.  It is manifested by \nextreme irritability, delirium, coma, tachycardia, restlessness, vomiting, jaundice, \ndiarrhea, hypotension, dehydration,and high fever.  \n \nTracheomalacia  \u2192 refers to tracheal weakness. It is an  abnormal collapse of the \ntracheal walls.  Tracheostomy or endotracheal intubation can damage the tracheal \ncartilage at the stoma or inflatable cuff site, respectively, which weakens the tracheal \nwall.  The major symptoms and signs of TM in adults are dysp nea, cough, and sputum \nretention.  Wheezing or stridor may also exist."

			"b": "Aspirin",
			"c": "Paracetamol",
			"d": "Venlafaxine",
			"e": "Organophosphates",
			"answer": "Paracetamol",
			"explanation": "The raised level of serum creatinine, bilirubin, liver enzymes as well as the increased \nprothrombin time indicates that this patient has taken an overdose of paracetamol.  \nParacetamol is an antipyretic and analgesic.  Patients are usually asymptomatic for the \nfirst 24 hours or have nonspecific abdominal symptoms.  Hepatic necros is begins to \ndevelop after 24 hours and can progress to acute liver failure.  The liver damage isnot \nusually detectable by routine liver function testuntil at least 18 hours after ingestion of \nparacetamol.  Alanine transferase (ALT), prothrombin time usual ly peak 72 to 96 hours \nafter ingestion.  In the United Kingdom, paracetamol can be purchased over the \ncounter; however, it is government legislation that it is not to be sold in excess of ten \ntablets at a time.  For an average person, 24 tablets usually co nstitute an overdose.  \n \nThe other answers are unlikely.  \n \nAmitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant.  TCA\u2019s taken in large amounts can cause \nexcess sedation, sympathomimetic effects (tachycardia, sweating, dilated pupils)  \n \nAspirin is a potent antiplatelet agent as well as an antipyretic, analgesic and anti -\ninflammatory agent.  An overdose of aspirin causes ringing in the ears, nausea, \nabdominal pain, and tachypnoea.  \n \nVenlafaxine is a type of antidepressant of the selective serotonin -norepinephrine \nreuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class often used to treat depression, anxiety and panic \nattacks.  Most patients overdosing with venlafaxine develop only mild symptoms of \nfeeling tired, palpitations and vomiting.  They rarely cause death.  \n \nOrganophosphates are usually the active ingredietn in insecticides.  Symptoms include \nincreased saliva and tear production, diarrhoea, vomiting, small pupils, sweating, \nmuscle tremors, and confusion.  \n \nPARACETAMOL (ACETAMINOPHEN) POISONING  \nInitial feature s \u2192 Nausea, vomiting, pallor  \nAfter 24 hours \u2192 Hepatic enzymes rise  \nAfter 48 hours \u2192 Jaundice, an enlarged, tender liver  \n \nHypoglycaemia, hypotension, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, coma may also occur. \nWhen to discharge home?

So, we would advise you to use the number 24 as a benchmark whereby \nif the patient consumes more than 24 tablets (12 g) of paracetamol, then you admit \nhim/her)  \n \nWhen to do a serum paracetamol concentration?  \n\u2022 At \u22654h post ingestion if consumed >150mg/kg (or an unkno wn amount)  \n \nWhen to give activated charcoal?  \n\u2022 If presenting < 1h, and >150mg/kg of tablets ingested  \n \nWhen to give N -acetylcysteine?  \n\u2022 If there is a staggered overdose (Note: a staggered overdose is if all the tablets were \nnot taken within 1 hour); or  \n\u2022 If there  is doubt over the time of paracetamol ingestion, regardless of the plasma \nparacetamol concentration; or  \n\u2022 If plasma paracetamol concentration (taken 4 hours\u2019 post ingestion) is above the \nappropriate line  \n\u2022 If patients present late (>8h) and ingested dose is >150mg/kg, (or dose is unknown)"

			"e": "Intravenous insulin",
			"answer": "Naloxone",
			"explanation": "A low respiratory rate, constricted pupils, semiconscious are features of opioid \npoisoning.  Naloxone is a specific antagonist for opioids and used especially in opioid \noverdose to reverse coma and respiratory depression.  When given intravenously, it can \nbegin to work within 2 minutes.  The usual initial dose of naloxone for ad ults is 0.8 mg \nintravenously (BNF says 0.4 mg initially then 0.8 mg).  Dosingmaybe repeated at 2 -3 \nminute intervals if there is minimal or no response.  In known or suspected drug addicts \nit is best to avoid reversing the opioid completely, so start with 0 .1 mg of Naloxone \nintravenously.  This again can be repeated at 2 -3 minutes intervals.  \n \nNaloxone has a much shorter duration of action compared to most opioids and so coma \nand respiratory depression recur when naloxone wears off thus repeated dosing may be  \nrequired at a later time.  \n \nIt is unlikely that the PLAB exam would ask you for the dose of Naloxone in the exam, \nbut it is worth remembering if you planto work in A&E in future.  \n \nPUPILLARY RESPONSES TO LIGHT  An acutely widely dilated pupil unilaterally may be seen in unilateral space -occupying \nlesions such as haematomas, tumours or abscesses.  \n \n \n \nBilateral abnormally constricted pupils may indicate opiate overdose or a \ncerebrovascular accident affecting the brainstem  \n \n \n \nBilaterally dilated pupils occur when there are sympathetic drugs that were taken e.g. \ntricyclic antidepressant overdose."

			"explanation": "The diagnosis here is clearly compartment syndrome given the history of the prolonged \nlimb compression.  The reason the dorsalis pedis pulse is not felt is because arterial \nblood flow is reduced when pressure exceeds systolic blood pressure.  Note that \nsensory deficit may occur in the distribution of nerves passing through the compartment \nwhich explains the reduced sensation in this stem.

This may be accompanied by a panic attack.  If this becomes more severe, \narterial hypocapnia may trigger cerebral vessel vasoconstriction leading to dizziness, \nfaintness, headaches and lose consciousness.  After losing consciousness, breathing \nand blood gases return to normal which restores cerebral blood flow.  The patient would \nshortly recover after that.  \n \nManagement includes rebreathing into the paper bag to terminate the attack.

			"e": "Increased anti -diuretic hormone",
			"answer": "Increased sympathetic activity  \n \nEXPLANA TION:  \nThis question is testing basic physiology.  \n \nAcute pain or trauma will activate your body\u2019s sympathetic nervous system.  This will \ncause many of the body\u2019s blood vessels to constrict and will cause the heart to increase \nthe rate and force of contraction.  \n \nThis patient has just experienced a traumatic accident and is probably bleeding \ninternally, as is evidenced by the abdominal bruising.  Excessive blood loss results in a drop of blood pressure.  However, the single most likely cause of his co ld and clammy \nperipheries is due to activation of the sympathetic nervous system causing constriction \nof the blood vessels.  This is due to a compensatory mechanism by the body to \npreserve itself.   \n \nAlthough severe trauma or stressful events can elevate c ortisol levels, this is not a \ndirect reason as to why this patient has cold and clammy peripheries.  \n \nThe parasympathetic nervous system acts in the opposite way as to the sympathetic \nnervous system.  An activation of the parasympathetic nervous system woul d cause \nvessel dilation and would cause the patient\u2019s peripheries to appear warm and flushed.  \n \nPeriods of stress and trauma also cause an increase in aldosterone and anti -diuretic \nhormone.  In addition, aldosterone would have been released in this patient due to \nactivation of the baroreceptors with the aim of causing sodium and water retention and \nthus increasing blood volume and blood pressure.

			"question": "A 5 year old boy was playing with his friends when one of his older friends \ncarrying a kettle of hot water accidentally tripped and  fell with the hot water \nspilling all over the child\u2019s left arm.  His parents quicky ran tepid tap water over \nhis right arm for 10 minutes.  He was then brought to the Paediatric A&E \nimmediately by his parents.  On assessment, partial thickness burns are s een \nwith multiple blisters over his left arm, forearm and hand.  What is the SINGLE \nmost appropriate management?",

			"b": "Deroofing of blisters",
			"c": "Burn dressing",
			"d": "Refer to a specialised burn service",
			"e": "Escharatomy",
			"answer": "Refer to a specialised burn service",
			"explanation": "This patient has a scald (a burn caused by contact with hot water or steam).  Scalds \nand burns are graded and managed in the same way.  \n \nAnalgesia should be the first thing to be prescribed and this patient should then  be \nreferred to a specialised burn service.  \n \nEvery hospital has different criterias to refer patients to specialised burn services.  Most \nof them would include the following criterias:  \n\u2022 More than 3% of total body surface area partial thickness burn  \n\u2022 Burns in volving the face, hands, feet, genitalia, perineum, or major joints  \n\u2022 All deep dermal and full thickness burns  \n\u2022 All burns associated with electrical shock or chemical burns  \n\u2022 All burns associated with non -accidental injury  \n\u2022 All burns with inhalation injury  \n \nHis hands are involved and there is significant amount of body surface area involved, so \nit would be appropriate to refer onto a specialist burn service which are run by \nexperienced burn surgeons.  Hand burns are not to be taken lightly because inadequate \nmana gement can result in a serious disability.  \n \nBecause burn units in the UK consist of experienced personnel with resources to \nmaximize outcome from these injuries, burned patients with these criteria are best \ntreated in such places.  \n \nThe story in this stem seems to match the physical findings of the scald.  However, it is \nimportant to keep at the back of your head that a significant percentage of burns in \nchildren are due to child abuse and so if the story did not match or there was a delay in \npresentin g, you may need to contact child protection and refer to the specialised burn \nservices for further evaluation.  \n \nNICE CKS suggest that blisters should be left intact wherever possible, to reduce the \nrisk of infection however large blisters that are likely t o rupture (greater than 1 cm2) can \nbe de -roofed under aseptic techniques.  As the size of the blisters are not mentioned in \nthis stem, de -roofing or aspirating the blisters may be a possibility however since we are \ncertain that this child needs to be transferred to a specialist burn service, that would be \nthe answer."

A calf swelling with a positive Homan\u2019s sign (pain when ankle is dorsiflexed) is commonly seen in deep vein \nthrombosis (DVT) and popliteal cyst ruptures.  \n \nAlthough there is no risk in th e stem for a DVT, it is still more common than a popliteal \ncyst rupture.  \n \nPopliteal cyst rupture can also cause calf pain and enlargement which is similar to a \nDVT.  However, popliteal cyst rupture would initially start with swelling and discomfort \nbehind the knee (representing the popliteal cyst) which is then followed by rupture which \nresults in pain and swelling in the calf that mimics DVT.

Following that, progressive \nmetabolic acidosis occurs.  This usually occurs around the 24 hour mark after ingestion \nfor adults.   \n \nParacetamol overdose may also cause metabolic acidosis in the early and late course \nof poisoning and thus paracetamol as an answer is not com pletely wrong.  However, \naspirin overdose is a more recognized cause of metabolic acidosis compared to \nparacetamol.  \n \nOverdose of Enalapril (ACE inhibitor) or Diclofenac (NSAIDs) cause metabolic alkalosis \nand not acidosis.  \n \nOverdose of Benzodiazepines would  cause respiratory acidosis.  \n \nIf suspecting metabolic acidosis do a blood gas.

Focused abdominal sonography \n(ultrasound) for trauma (FAST) is regarded as the investigation of choice for early \ndiagnostic investigations in patients with suspected blunt abdominal trauma and it is \nregarded as the invest igation of choice for unstable patients.  Free fluid in a \nhaemodynamically unstable patient indicates the need for emergency laparotomy.  \nHowever, this patient is stable and does not warrant an immediate laparotomy.  The \nFAST scans are typically used to en hance the speed of trauma assessment, reduce the \nnumber of CT scans and cut cost.  However, this patient has already had a CT scan, \nthus an ultrasound scan would not give any added information in regards to an acute \nabdomen.  \n \nSolid organ injury in haemodyn amically stable patients can often be managed without \nsurgery but would require observation for awhile before discharge."

It is a diag nosis of exclusion.  \n Symptoms include vocal fatigue (voice becoming worse with use) and laryngeal \ndiscomfort.  There may be various interacting causes, such as heavy demands on the \nvoice, poor vocal technique and stress.  \n \nThe case given above gives a history of voice overuse.  This is a common problem in \nsome occupations such as acting and teaching.  It may also follow unaccustomed voice \nuse, such as shouting at a football match.  Vocal strain may be exacerbated when \nattempting to compensate for an acu te respiratory infection.  Given that there is no \noption to pick voice overuse and since there is no structural or neurological pathology, \nfunctional dysphonia is the best option.  \n \nRecurrent laryngeal nerve palsy mainly presents with voice changes as well but there is \nusually an obvious cause like trauma during surgery (especially thyroid surgery), tumour \nspread, bulbar palsy, or penetrating wounds none of which was mentioned in this stem.  \n \nAngioedema in severe cases can cause hoarseness but it also present s with difficulty in \nbreathing which is not the case here.  \n \nLaryngeal obstruction like angioedema would have difficulty in breathing.  \n \nLaryngitis would have been the best option provided that the hoarseness of voice \noccurred during the respiratory infectio n prior to treatment.

			"answer": "Acute tonsillitis",
			"explanation": "Tonsillitis is usually caused by a viral infection or, less commonly, a bacterial infection.   \nThe given case is a bacterial tonsillitis (probably caused a streptococcal infection). Note  \nthat the pain for tonsillitis may be referred to the ears.  \n \nIf the sore throat is due to a viral infection the symptoms are usually milder and often  \nrelated to the common cold.  \n \nIn streptococcal  infection the tonsils often swell and become coated and the throat is  \nsore. The patient has a temperature, foul -smelling breath and may feel quite ill. The  \ndifferences are variable and it is impossible to tell on inspection if the infection is viral  or \nbacterial in real life. However in PLAB, look for these main four signs that point  towards \ntonsillitis being caused by a bacterial infection rather than a viral infection.  \n \n4 signs:  \n\u2022 a high temperature  \n\u2022 white pus -filled spots on the tonsils  \n\u2022 no cough  \n\u2022 swollen and tender lymph nodes (glands)  \n \nNote: In this question it is unlikely to be Infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) as it  \naffects teenagers most often.

			"b": "Functional hearing loss",

			"answer": "Otosclerosis",
			"explanation": "Weber\u2019s test lateralized to the right and bone conduction is better than air conductionon \nthe right. This clearly shows a conductive deafness on the right. There are no  features \nof encephalopathy. Tympanosclerosis has characteristic chalky white patches  seen on \ninspection of the eardrum. Since the eard rum here was viewed as normal, it is  unlikely \nto be tympanosclerosis.  \n \nThe only answer left would be otosclerosis. Bone and air conduction must be tested  \nand in otosclerosis it typically reveals a purely conductive, predominantly low -tone loss.  \n \nOther hint s in this stem are:  \n \n\u2022 Female gender \u2013 otosclerosis usually occurs in females (2:1 female:male ratio)  \u2022 Pregnancy \u2013 pregnancy accelerates the progression of osteosclerosis  \n \nRinne's and Weber's test  \nPerforming both Rinne's and Weber's test allows differentiation of conductive and  \nsensorineural deafness.  \n \nRinne's test  \nA tuning fork is placed over the mastoid process until the sound is no longer heard,  \nfollowed by repositioning just over external acoustic meatus  \n\u2022 Note that air conduction (AC) is normally better than bone conduction (BC) (Positive \nRinne's test)  \n\u2022 If BC > AC, then the patient has conductive deafness (Negative Rinne\u2019s test)  \n\u2022 (Abnormal Rinne\u2019s test)  \n \nNote that the words positive and negative are used in a somewhat confusing fashion  \nhere,  as compared to their normal use in medical tests. Positive or negative in this case  \nmeans that a certain parameter that was evaluated was present or not. In this case,  that \nparameter is whether air conduction (AC) is better than bone conduction (BC).  \n \nThus, a \"positive\" result indicates the healthy state, in contrast to many other medical  \ntests. Therefore, some prefer to avoid using the term 'positive' or 'negative', and simply  \nstate if the test was normal or abnormal e.g. 'Rinne's test was abnormal in the  right ear,  \nwith bone conduction greater than air conduction'.  \n \nWeber's test  \nA tuning fork is placed in the middle of the forehead equidistant from the patient's  ears. \nThe patient is then asked which side is loudest  \n\u2022 If sound is localised to the unaffecte d side, then this is unilateral sensorineural  \ndeafness  \n\u2022 If sound is localised to the affected side, then this is unilateral conductive  deafness  \n \nExample  \nIf Weber\u2019s test localises to the right side. It can either be right conductive deafness OR  \nleft sensorineural deafness. A Rinne\u2019s test would be able to confirm if it is a right  \nconductive deafness . \n \nOTOSCLEROSIS  \nIn otosclerosis, there is a pathological increased bony turnover leading to sclerosis and  \nfailure of the sound conduction mechanism. This is due to ankylosis of the stapes  \nfootplate in the fenestra ovalis of the cochlea. This reduces normal sound transmission  \nresulting in a conductive deafness.  \n \nOtosclerosis is the commonest cause of progressive deafness in young adults .  It \nusually presents between 15 and 45 years of age.   \nGenetic factors are involved, so the condition often (but not always) runs in families.  \nThe family history is especially important to note as it is commonly given in the stem if  \nthe question writers want you to pick otosclerosis.  \n \nIt is bilateral in 80% of cases, although it is not uncommon for one ear to be worse than \nthe other.  \n \nUntreated, the deafness gradually worsens. Other symptoms of otosclerosis include \ntinnitus and  vertigo.  \n \nIt is progressive  and there is no curative treatment at the moment. The m anagement  \ninvolves either surgery  (stapedectomy or stapedotomy, with the insertin of a prosthesis) \nor bilateral hearing aids  for those not fit for surgery . \n \nKey features for otosclerosis:  \n\u2022 Main symptoms are progressive hearing loss and tinnitus  \n\u2022 Majority of the time it is bilateral  \n\u2022 Conductive hearing loss ( where the cochlea is involved there may be a mixed \nconductive/sensory pattern of hearing loss)  \n\u2022 A family history of hearing loss"

			"explanation": "Hearing screening is offered to all babies in England within 4 to 5 weeks of birth.  \nBabies who were born in the hospital are normally given a newborn hearing test before \nthey are discharged otherwise it would be done in the first few weeks of  life by a health \nvisitor.   \n \nThe hearing screening programme offers 2 types of test:  \n\u2022 Automated otoacoustic emission (AOAE)  \n\u2022 Automated auditory brainstem response  \n \nAutomated otoacoustic emission (AOAE) test takes a few minutes.  A soft -tipped \nearpiece is placed in the newborn\u2019s ear and clicking sounds are played.  Vibration of the \nhair cells in response to noise generates acoustic energy which is detected by a \nmicrophone in the external meatus.  If AOAE test is performed and there is no clear \nresponse in one or both eares, then the automated auditory brainstem response \n(AABR) test is performed.  \n \nThe AABR test involves placing 3 electrodes on the infant\u2019s forehead and neck.  \nClicking sounds are then played.  The electrodes would measure brain wav e activity in \nresponse to the clicks.  \n \nGiven that AOAE test is not even an option in this question, the next most appropriate \nanswer would be the AABR test.

They evaluate the natural history of a condition.  \nPatients are divided into specific groups basedon their exposure characteristics and \nfollowed up over a period of time to determine if the outcome or diseae of interest \ndevelops.  \n \nThe distractor here is a case -control study .  Case -control studies are retrospective.  \nThey look at two groups at the start: one with the outcome or disese and one without \nthe outcome or disease.  They look retrospectively (back in the past) to assess if there \nwas a significant difference in the ra tes of exposure to a definedr isk ffactor between the \ngroups.  \n \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \nCase series and case reports.   These are reports of cases and use no control groups \nor patient groups to compare outcomes.  They are similar to writing a report on a topic \nthat you have read.  \n \nCase -control study.   This is a study in which patients who already have a specific \ncondition are compared with people who do not have that particular condition.  These \nstudy designs are observational, meaning that researches study but do n ot alter what \noccurs.  They look retrospectively (back in the past) to assess if there was a significant \ndifference in the rates of exposure to a defined risk factor between the groups.  \nExample, group A consist of patients with lung cancer and group B con sists of patients \nwithout lung cancer.  Information is collected looking back at their smoking history.  The \nhypothesis would be that smoking would incur a higher risk of lung cancer.  \n \nCohort study.   These studies identify a group of people who share a def ining \ncharacteristic.  This group is then compared with a similar group of people with the \nsame defining characteristic.  Cohort studies are purely observational and may be \nprospective (going forward in time) or retrospective (happened in the past).  Becau se \nthese studies are observational, the researchers (like in case -control studies) do not \nintervene with the groups of people.  Example of a prospective cohort study, group A \nare patients who smoke, group B are patients who do not smoke.  They are followed  in \ntime to determine who develops lung cancer.  \n \nWhat is the difference between a case -control study and a retrospective cohort study?  \nIn case -control, one starts with the outcomes andstudies the exposure.  In retrospective \ncohort studies, one already has determined the exposure, but now needs to study the \nassociation of exposure to disease outcome.  \n \nRandomised controlled clinical trial.   These are experiments that introduce a \ntreatment or exposure to study its effect on real patients.  It usually compares an active \ngroup with a control group and employs methods such as randomisation and blinding to reduce bias.  Typically, new drugs are tested this way.  Example, a group of patients \nwith disease X who meet specific criteria, are randomly allocated to receiv e either the \nexperimental treatment or the control treatment (either the standard treatement for \ndisease X or a placebo).  Both groups are then followed in time, and the outcomes are \nobserved.  \n \nCross -sectional study.  This is a study that describes the rel ationship between \ndiseases and other factors at one point in time in a defined population.  They are often \nused for comparing diagnostic tests.  A good example would be researches performing \na survey on a population to detemine the relationship between inc reased levels of \nserum cholesterol and electrocardiographic evidence of coronary artery disease.  Both \nthe exposure and the disease outcome are taken at the same point of time.  It is like a \nsnapshot of a population at a specific time.  \n \nSystemic review.   This focuses on a clinical topic and answers a specific question that \narises.  \n \nMeta -analysis.   This is a study that examines a number of studies on a topic and \nmathematically combines the results to report the results as if it were one large study."

			"explanation": "Risk ratios are an important topic in PLAB as it is one of the main epidemiologic \nquestions asked.  \n \nAbsolute risk (AR)  of a disease is your risk of developing the disease over a time \nperiod.  The same absolute risk can be expressed in differen t ways.  For example, say \nyou have a 1 in 10 risk of developing a certain disease in your life.

For  \nexample, consider the risk for blindness in a patient with diabetes over a 5 -year period.   \nIf the risk for blindness is 4 in 100 (4%) in a group of patients treated conventionally  \n(control group) and 3 in 100 (3% ) in patients treated with a new drug (experimental  \ngroup), the relative risk is the ratio of the two risks.

			"e": "An initial randomisation error.",
			"answer": "Breakdown of the double -blind study",
			"explanation": "For some questions such as this, it is necessary to select an answer based on the \nprocess of elimination.  \n \nFailure of the active drug is incorrect seeing as how a more significant percentage of the \nplacebo group withdrew.  \n \nInsufficient information to interpret data occurs when researchers do not have sufficient \nresults to analyse the study.   \nChance even in this context means that a specific cause cannot explain the peopl e\u2019s \nwithdrawal i.e. the dropout was by chance.  The issue with this statement is the massive \ndiscrepancy in dropouts of the placebo group compared to the experimental group. An \nacceptable dropout rate between groups is considered to be less than 15%.  Here  we \nsee a drop out rate difference of 22%.  Furthermore, we would expect a dropout rate to \nbe small given that the study is only for one year.  A study of 10 years may have a \ndropout rate difference of 20% to 25% which is acceptable because patients are of ten \nlost to follow up as it is such a lengthy study.  Dropouts not related to systemic bias \ncould occur due to an unrelated illness, death, or job relocation.  That being said, a \nstudy that only lasts for one year should have dropout rates that are near to  zero for it to \nbe considered a chance event.  \n \nAn initial randomisation error is a possibility although the stem gives no information as \nto how the patients were selected.  If methodologies were not appropriate, it could lead \nto bias and compromise the stu dy. \n \nThe best answer is that there is a breakdown of the double -blind study.  A breakdown in \nthe study can occur if people from either group find out that they are in the experimental \ngroup or the control group.  Patients in the placebo group may have foun d that they \nhave been taking placebo medication and hence decided to leave.  This would result in \na very high percentage of people in the placebo group leaving which is precisely what \nwe see in this case."

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the law  \non parents overriding young people\u2019s competent refu sal is complex. You should seek  \nlegal advice if you think treatment is in the best interests of a competent young person  \nwho refuses.  \n \nNote that the ability to consent changes if you are under 13.

			"answer": "Refer for assessment of capacity",
			"explanation": "Referring the patient for assessment of her capacity is the best possible choice out of  \nthe given choices. A safe answer for PLAB 1 exam ethics questions is always \ndiscussing  and exploring patient concerns.  \n \nAllowing her to change her will would be the correct choice if she wasn\u2019t diagnosed  with \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease. Patient autonomy is the founding principal of U.K medical  practice \nand we should always endeavor to maintain patient autonomy a t all times.  \n \nRefusing her to change her will is the incorrect choice because without an evaluation of  \nwhether she has capacity or not, this would be a violation of the U.K code of ethics.  \n \nThere was no mention in the stem that her granddaughter is indeed her caretaker, and  \neven if her granddaughter was her caretaker, important decisions that impact on the  \npatient cannot be undertaken by a caretaker without a power of attorney document  \n(which also was not mentioned in the stem).  \n \nThe Mental Capacity Act of 2005 seeks to empower and protect people who may not  \nbe able to make some decisions for themselves. It also enables people to plan ahead in  \ncase they are unable to make important decisions for themselves in the future. The law  \nworks on the principle that e veryone is assumed to have capacity to make decisions for  \nthemselves if they are given enough information, support and time. It protects their  right \nto make their own decisions and to be involved in any decisions that affect them.   A \nperson's capacity must  be judged according to the specific decision that need to be  \nmade, and not solely because of their illness, disability, age, appearance or behaviour.   \nAn important principle in the law is that just because someone is making what seems to  \nbe an unwise deci sion (even if they have an illness or disability) this does not  \nnecessarily mean they lack capacity."

This is a very good reason why we should always \nstart off with narr ow spectrum antibiotics such as trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin for \nsimple urinary tract infections.  \n \nIn the exam, look out for antibiotic usage like cephalosporins, clindamycin, co -\namoxiclav, and amoxicillin as a cause for Clostridium difficile.  \n \nCLOSTRID IUM DIFFICILE  \nClostridium difficile is a Gram positive rod often encountered in hospital practice.

			"explanation": "The World Health Organisation classification of diarrhoea is as follows:  \n\u2022 Diarrhoea > 3 loose or watery stool per day  \n\u2022 Acute diarrhoea < 14 days  \n\u2022 Chronic diarrhoea > 14 days  \n \nAccording to the above classification, it is too early to decide in this patient if he i s \nsuffering from ulcerative colitis or not because he has had diaarhoea for only the last \nseven days.  At this stage, it is best to exclude the infectious causes first by doing a \nstool microscopy, culture and sensitivity test.  \n \nIn such cases, the investiga tions largely depend on the clinical setting.  For example, in \nprimary care the main aim is to make the diagnosis and in secondary care, to confirm \nthe diagnosis as well as to assess the severity and extent of the disease.  \n \nIn primary care, the test must i nclude a stool culture and sensitivity to exclude the \ninfectious causes of diarrhoea such as salmonella, shigella, eschericia coli, clostridium \ndifficile, campylobacter and giardiasis.  Once the infectious causes are excluded, further \ndiagnostic tests like  colonoscopy with biopsy can be done in secondary care.  \n \nFaecal test is not the correct option.  A faecal fat test is primarily ordered when a person \nhas signs and symptoms of malabsorption such as steatorrhea, persistent diarrhoea, abdominal pain, bloatin g, weight loss and failure to thrive (in children)  \n \nThe faecal antigen test is a stool test which is used to detect helicobacter pylori.  It is an \nirrelevant test to perform in this particular patient."

			"c": "Benign oesophageal stricture",
			"d": "Barrett\u2019s Oesophagus",
			"e": "Pharyngeal pouch",
			"answer": "Benign oesophageal stricture",
			"explanation": "Benign oesophageal strictures  \u2013 are usually the result of scarring from acid reflux in \nsevere and persistent GORD.  It may also follow ingestion of corrosives.  While the area \nheals, a scar forms, causing the tissue to pull and tighten, leading to difficulty in \nswallowing.  Certain dr ugs like alendronate and NSAIDs have the potential to cause \nstrictures due to their side effects which worsen GORD.  This is seen in this stem where \nthe patient is taking alendronate.  This is the reason that it is so important to advise \npatients not to li e down for at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate as this will help \nalendronate reach the stomach faster and prevent irritation of the oesophagus.  \n \nOesophageal carcinoma  \u2013 The absence of any significant weight loss makes \noesophageal carcinoma a less likely diagnosis.  Although it is important to note that any \ncause of dysphagia can essentially cause weight loss.  This includes both benign \noesophageal stricture and achalasia.  \n \nBarrett\u2019s oesophagus  \u2013 Would also have a long history of gastro -oesophageal reflux \nwhich is seen in this stem however, the symptoms of dysphagia is usually occasional \nrather than persistent.  \n \nPharyngeal pouch  \u2013 Usually presents with a history of halitosis and regurgitation of \nundigested food, a sensation of a lump on the throat, n eck bulge.  \n \nAchalasia  \u2013 While the most common feature is dysphagia, regurgitation is a very \ncommon feature of achalasia and occurs in around 80 -90% of sufferers.  \n Please note that if this stem did not include the history of taking Alendronate, the \nanswer i s still likely to be benign oesophageal stricture given that there is less evidence \nfor any other opiton."

			"explanation": "Acute cholecystitis presents with severe continuous right upper quadrant pain which can \nbe seen to radiate to right flank and back.  A fever like in this stem is also associated \nwith it.  Nausea and vomiting are often seen with cholecystitis.  \n \nJaundice can be a feature of obstruction of the biliary tract and can be seen in \ncholecystitis however, it is often mild or not seen unless there is presence of gallstones \nin the common bile duct (choledocholithiasis).  In this stem, jaundice is absent.  \n \nThe examination here shows a positive Murphy\u2019s sign.  Remember, Murphy sign is not \njust pain, but it is the arrest of inspiration when pressing the right costal margin at the \nmidcl avicular line.  It is a sign of acute cholecystitis.  It is sensitive, but not specific to cholecystitis.  \n \nThere is an elevation of ALP in this stem which ALP rises much higher than ALT which \npoints towards a form of biliary obstruction with cholestasis.  \n \nThe likely scenario here is that there are gallstones that are obstructing the cystic duct \ncausing acute cholecystitis.  Remember, more than 90% of the time, acute cholecystitis \noccurs from blockage of the cystic duct by a gallstone.  When th is occurs, the patient \nwould experience biliary colic.  \n \nChronic cholecystitis is incorrect here as chronic cholecystitis occurs when there are \nrepeated episodes of infection causing thickening and fibrosis of gallbladder.  \n \nAcute pancreatitis is incorrect a s the amylase is within normal limits in this stem.  \n \nAcute Cholecystitis  \nAcute cholecystitis follows stone or sludge impaction in the neck of the \ngallbladder,which may cause continuous epigastric or RUQ pain (referred to the right \nshoulder),vomiting, fever , local peritonism, or a gallbladder mass.  \n \nThe main difference from biliary colic is the inflammatory component (local \nperitonism,fever, and elevated WCC).  \n \nIf the stone moves to the common bile duct (CBD), obstructive jaundice and \ncholangitismay occur  \n \nMurphy\u2019s sign is positive when you lay 2 fingers over the RUQ and ask patient \ntobreathe in which causes pain & arrest of inspiration as an inflamed gallbladder \nimpingeson your fingers. It is only positive if the same test in the LUQ does not cause \npain.  \n \nTests: \nWCC would be elevated  \nUltrasound shows a thick -walled, shrunken gallbladder  \n \nManagement:  \nNil by mouth, pain relief, IV fluids, and antibiotics.  \n \nOnce symptoms settle, do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. \nLaparoscopiccholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for all patients fit for general \nanaesthesia.Open surgery is required if there is gall bladder perforation."

The pain is worse after eating leading to a \ndislike of eating with consequent weight loss. The second most predominant feature is \nmalabsorption which is represented here by steatorrhoea.

In real ity, it is \ndifficult to differentiate the two hence the importance of imaging modalities such as \nultrasounds and CT scans.  \n \nIn chronic pancreatitis, plain abdominal films of pancreas can show diffuse calcifications \nwhich indicate significant damage to the pancreas.

He complained of no altered bowel habits, sweating, \ndysphagia or generalised weakness. There was no history of non -steroidal anti -\ninflammatory drug (NSAID) use or rece nt infections.  A neighbour advised him to \ntry a popular heartburn remedy so he went to his local pharmacy andtried an \nover -the-counter medication (Gaviscon \u00ae).

Urea can be labelled with two different carbon isotopes: C14 and C13.  \nThe main difference between them is that the former is radioactive, whereas the latter is \nstable.  The C13 urea breath test is the recommended test to perform.  This is because \nit is a non -radioactive isotope which can be used safel y for repeated testing, which is \nfrequently required in clinical practice.  \n \nEndoscopy is only required if H. pylori is completely eradicated, as shown by urea \nbreath testing, to further investigate the cause of dyspepsia."

			"c": "Urgent laparoscopy",
			"d": "Intravenous antibiotics",
			"e": "Cholecystectomy",
			"answer": "Fluid resuscitation, analgesia and nutritional support",
			"explanation": "The likely diagnosis is acute pancreatitis given the elevated amylase.  \n \nThe initial treatment for acute pancreatitis is suppor tive and includes earely fluid \nresuscitation, analgesia, and nutritional support.  \n \nParenteral nutrition is only used when the enteral route is not tolerated, or if it is not \nmeeting specific caloric requirements.  \n \nSurgical debridement may be required where  there is proven infection and necrosis.  \nNote that laparoscopic surgical debridement has largely been replaced by newer \nminimally invasive techniques such as transgastric endoscopy and video -assisted \ntranslumbare retroperitoneal necrosectomy followd by cl osed lavage of infected \npancreatic necrosis and so urgent laparoscopy is not the answer here.  Also remember \nthat there need to be some evidence of necrosis before surgical debridement is \nconsidered.  \n \nIntravenous antibiotics (e.g. IV imipenem) can be start ed in moderate to severe cases \neven without evidence of infected necrosis.  This should preferably follow percutaneous \naspiration of peritoneal fluid for culture however in this case, fluid resuscitation, analgesia and nutritional support are more importan t than just antibiotics.  \n \n60% of acute pancreatitis in adults in the UK are due to gallstones and thus \ncholecystectomy can be considered but should only be considered after the initial \nsymptoms of acute pancreatitis have resolved."

			"c": "IV fluids",

			"e": "Urinary catheterisation",
			"answer": "Phosphate enemas",
			"explanation": "This is an example of overflolw diarrhoea.  Medications such as opioid pain relievers \nreduce intestinal movement and may causefaecal matter to become too large, hard and \ndry making it difficult to expel.   Subsequently, faeces become so harde that they cannot \nbe expelled and faecal fluid will flow around the block.  \n \nPhosphate enemas contain acid phosphate and sodium phosphate.  The osmotic \nactivity of the former increases the water contact of the stool so that rectal distension \nfollows and it is thought that this induces defecation by stimulating rectal motility.  It has \na very quick onset of action which makes enemas useful for when a rapid evacuation of \na stony dull faecal impaction is required.  \n \nPhosphate enema is the clear asnwer here as the question is addressing the immediate \nmanagement.  \n \nIt is important to remember the relation between elderly, bedridden individuals and \nfaecal impaction.  Fecal impaction isa fairly common complication of long -term \nconstipation in the elderly and bedridden, occurring in about 30% of all nursing home \nresidents.

			"question": "A 14 year old boy was brought to the hospital by his parents because of a painful \nswelling located in his neck.  Physical examination revealed that the swelling is \nlocated in the midline of his neck below the hyoid bone just in front of the \ntrachea.  It was also established that the mass is a palpable non -tender mobile \nfluid filled lump that moves upwards on swallowing and on protrusion of the \ntongue.  It was measured to be about 1.5 cm in diameter.  After a th orough history \nand physical examination had been performed, the patient was suspected to have \na thyroglossal cyst.  What is the SINGLE most appropriate investigation to \nperform?  \n \nANSWER:  \nUltrasound of the neck  \n \nEXPLANATION:  \nA thyroglossal cyst is a fibroid  cyst that forms from a persistent thyroglossal duct.  It \nusually presents as an asymptomatic fluid -filled midline neck mass below the level of \nthe hyoid bone.  It is benign and results from an incomplete closure of the thyroid\u2019s \nmigration path during feta l development.  \n \nIt typically presents as a painless anterior midline neck mass and is found most often in \nchildhood or adolescence.  This is a very important point to remember.  Thyroglossal \ncyst accounts for around 75% of midline masses in children.  \n \nThyroglossal cysts are congenital, however, the diagnosis can be made at any age with \nmost of them diagnosed before 10 years of age.  \n \nHow do you diagnose a thyroglossal cyst?  \n \nUltrasound of the cyst is a sensible next step and is performed to di stinguish a solid cyst \nfrom fluid -filled components and to visualize the degree of the mass as well as its \nsurrounding tissues.  It is the first line imaging study and ultrasound alone can be \nsufficient to conform the diagnosis in majority of cases.  \n MRI o r CT are used when malignancy is suspected but are not used routinely unless \nthere is a large cyst.  \n \nThyroid scan with technitium 99m(Tc -99m) can be used to determine if there are any \nectopic thyroid tissue.  Remember, the wall of a thyroglossal duct cyst is the second \nmost common site for ectopic thyroid tissue.  \n \nFine needle aspiration cytology is performed in order to establish the character of the \ncells inside the cyst.  However, given the low incidence of carcinoma in thyroid cyst  \nespecially in children, preoperative biopsy of thyroglossal cyst is not cost effective and \nis not recommended.  \n \nDiagnostic steps always move from least invasive to most invasive.  In majority of \nquestions, the most appropriate investigation would be the g old standard diagnostic \nstep which normally involves a biopsy.  This is not the case for thyroglossal cyst.  \nUltrasound still remains the most appropriate investigation here.  \n \nQ-2 \nA 60 year old man has right upper quadrant discomfort.

Her past medical history is significant for gallstone disease as \nconfirmed on ultrasou nd.  Her last episode of biliary colic was three years ago, \nfor which she received analgesia.  Each episode of pain that she has presented \nwith in the past has been managed successfully with morphine and has resolved \ncompletely after treatment with analges ia.  Her medical notes show that the last \nultrasound that she had shows an increased common bile duct diameter.  What is \nthe SINGLE best investigation to perform now for this patient?",
			"a": "ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography)",

			"c": "Repeat ultrasound",
			"d": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy",
			"e": "Dissolution of gallstones",
			"answer": "Repeat ultrasound",
			"explanation": "The fact that this patient already has confirmed gallstones seen on ultrasound with an \nincreased common bile duct diameter means that it is highly likely that she is having a \nrepeat episode of biliary colic or perhaps even cholangitis.  The next best investigation \nwould be to confirm the diagnosis on a repeat ultrasound.  \n \nERCP is used primarily to dia gnose and treat conditions of the bile ducts and main \npancreatic duct.  Newer modalities such as MRCP produce detailed images of the \nhepatobiliary and pancreatic systems.  This means that ERCP is now rarely performed \nwithout therapeutic intent.  \n \nBILIARY COLIC  \nOccurs when a stone temporarily occludes the cystic duct. There is a colicky pain in \ntheright upper quadrant radiating to right shoulder. The pain can also radiate to the back \nin the interscapular region.  Nausea and vomiting are common which often \naccompanies the pain.  The episode is usually self limiting.Ultrasound establishes \ndiagnosis of gallstones.  \n \nContrary to its name \u201cBiliary colic\u201d, the pain usually does not fluctuate but instead is \nconsistent and can last anywhere between 15 minutes up to 2 4 hours where the pain \ngradually subsides spontaneously or with the help of analgesia.  \n \nThe main difference of biliary colic and acute cholecystitis is the \ninflammatorycomponent. In acute cholecystitis there is local peritonism, fever, and \nelevated WCC.  \n \nManagement includes:  \n\u2022 Analgesia (usually opioids such as morphine)  \n\u2022 Rehydrate  \n\u2022 Nil by mouth.  \n\u2022 Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is usually indicated"

Superior laryngeal nerve damage  \n \nA unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve damage damage results in hoarseness and for  \nbilateral damage symptoms include aphonia and airway obstruction.  \n \nThe external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is one of the nerves \ncommonlyinjured in thyroid surgery. Injury to this nerve  results in the inability to \nlengthen a vocalfold and, thus, inability to create a high -pitched sound (dysphonia). \nThey would have amono toned voice. This would be detrimental to a person who is a a \nprofessional singer.So in this stem, injury to the extern al branch of superior laryngeal \nnerve is likely toproduce symptoms of dysphonia.  \n \nTHYROIDECTOMY COMPLICATIONS  \nHypocalcaemia  \n\u2022 Surgery can lead to trauma to the parathyroids, devascularization of the glands with \nresultant ischaemia, or removal of the glands d uring surgery.

Additional findings \nmay develop, including carpopedal spasm, tetany, laryngospasm, seizures, QT \nprolongation and cardiac arrest.  Chvostek\u2019s s ign is facial contractions elicited by \ntapping the facial nerve in the pre -auricular area.

A silent abdomen is more diagnostic of \nparalytic ileus, whereas noisy bowel  sounds indicate a mechanical obstruction.  Another \ndifferentiating point is the absence of pain in this patient.  Paralytic ileus tends to have \nless abdominal pain compared to mechanical obstruction.   \nThe best way to treat this patient is to pass a nasoga stric tube to remove the swallowed \nair and prevent gaseous distension.

A raised white cell count and CRP is not uncommon for a post -op \npatient and therefore antibiotics should not be initiated based on just these findings.   \n \nSingle dose antibiotics are typically given on induction and it is not unless the patient is \nunwell or is pyrexic that it would be approprite to start intravenous antibiotics.  This is \nbecause anastomotic leaks and wound infections are the feared complicatio ns of \nsigmoid colectomy.  \n \nIn this case, he is completely asymptomatic so the best answer would be to repeat the \nwhite blood cell count and CRP in 24 hours.  If these levels are seen decreasing the \nfollowing day, it is a reassuring sign and no action would be required."

			"explanation": "Patients can develop acute gastric dilatation as a postoperative complication \nofsplenectomy and abdominal surgery. This is due to disruption of blood supply to \nthestomach which predisposes to acute gastric dilatation. One of the causes of acute \ngastricdilatation is If the patient drinks too soon after an abdominal surgery when the \nstomachis still in ileus.

A f istula may form following an incision and \ndrainage of an abscess hence the reason that a subareolar abscess is included in the \nhistory in this stem.

This is not strictly true, \nas theinternal ring is always lateral to the femoral canal and a small indirect inguinal \nhernia willtherefore be lateral to the pubic tubercle. A better test to differentiate the two \nmight beto place the finger over the femoral canal for reducible hernias and then ask the \npatientto cough. When the patient coughs, a femo ral hernia should remain reduced \nwhile aninguinal hernia will reappear as an obvious swelling.  \n \nRemember, inguinal hernias has impulse on coughing or bearing down. Femoral \nherniasare usually irreducible (due to the narrow femoral canal) and cough impulse \nrarelydetectable.  \n \nIncarcerated hernia cannot be pushed back into the abdomen by applying \nmanualpressure and hence are irreducible.  \n \nStrangulated hernia are also irreducible.

In an indirect inguinal hernia, the protrusion passes through the \ndeepinguinal ring and is located lateral to the inferior epigastric artery. Whil st \ntraditionaltextbooks describe the anatomical differences between indirect (hernia \nthrough theinguinal canal) and direct hernias (through the posterior wall of the inguinal \ncanal), thisis of no clinical relevance as the management still remains the same.

			"question": "A 64 year old man has just had major abdominal surgery.  He is not a known \nsmoker and takes no chronic medications.  His post -operative pain is being \neffectively controlled with epidural analgesia.  Ten hours post -operatively, he was \nnoticed to have only pa ssed 30 ml of urine in his catheter bag.  The patient is \notherwise alert, oriented and well.  His blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg and his \npulse rate is 90 beats/minute.  What is the SINGLE most appropriate initial step \nfor this patient?",
			"a": "Stop epidural analge sia",
			"b": "Check urinary catheter",
			"c": "Administer intravenous fluids",
			"d": "Ultrasound of bladder",
			"e": "Alpha blocker treatment",
			"answer": "Check urinary catheter",
			"explanation": "The fact that he still has a catheter, the initial step would be to check the catheter.  \nSometimes the cath eter or drainage bag tubing may be kinked and you just need to \nstraighten it.  It could also be that the catheter is blocked in which case a simple flush \nmay fix it.  The position of the catheter and drainage back is also important whereby it \nshould be pos itioned below your bladder for urine to drain.  \n \nPost-operative urinary retention cannot happen when he has a urinary catheter in situ.  \nThus, there would be less of a reason to perform an ultrasound of the bladder at this \nstage.  In whichever case, stopping analgesia would be the wrong answer as this patient has just undergone a major abdominal surgery and requires analgesia for \nadequate management of his pain.  \n \nAdministration of fluids may be considered if we are considering an intraabdominal \nbleed as a cause of an acute kidney injury resulting in decre ased urine output.  This is \nnot the case here as this patient is normotensive.  \n \nIf the patient had postoperative hypotension and consequently developed oliguria, it \nwould be reasonable to correct this by means of a fluid challenge.  Patients can develop \npostoperative hypotension and decreased urine output due to several reasons, one of \nwhich is haemorrhage.  \n \nIn addition to this, oliguria may be caused by the adrenal cortex and posterior pituitary \nresponse tostress which release aldosterone and ADH  respectively.  Mainly this can \nhappen during the first 24 hours after an operation is essential to know that oliguria \nshould be temporary and not last more than 24 hours.  If a urine output is less than 400 \nml in the first 24 hours, further investigations  are warranted.  \n \nWhat does fluid challenge mean?  \nThis involves the following steps:  \n\u2022 Rapid (up to 15 minute) administration of 500 ml crystalloid (normal \nsaline/Hartmann\u2019s)  \n\u2022 Immediate reassessment \u2013 if there is still evidence of hypovolaemia administer a \nfurther bolus of a crystalloid  \n \nIn practice, doctors often prescribe 1 L of a crystalloid stat.  \n \nWhy choose a crystalloid over a colloid for resuscitation?  \nTheoretically, colloids exert more osmotic load and is able to keep more fluids \nintravascularly however  there is evidence of increased rates of renal failure associated \nwith colloid resuscitation and one has to take into account that colloids are a lot more \nexpensive than crystalloids.  For those reasons, clinicians prefer the use of crystalloids \nas a choic e of fluid for resuscitation."

Her family history is significant for her grandmother \nhaving passed away from breast cancer, her mother having had a right \nmastectomy last year and her sis ter who was diagnosed with breast cancer at age \n38 who is currently in remission from breast cancer.  Gene typing was done \nbased on her family history and the presence of the BRCA1 gene mutation were \nshown in this patient.  Her last mammogram was 6 months ago and was found to \nbe normal.  Examination of the breast revealed no skin changes, no nipple \nchanges and no masses.  A 1 cm by 1 cm, smooth and non -tender lymph node \nwas found in her axilla.  What is the SINGLE most appropriate next step for this \npatient ?",
			"a": "Mammogram",
			"b": "Ultrasound of the breast",
			"c": "Sentinel node biopsy",
			"d": "Fine needle aspiration",
			"e": "Offer prophylactic mastectomy",
			"answer": "Offer prophylactic mastectomy",
			"explanation": "A prophylactic mastectomy might seem drastic at this stage but with her family history \nand genetic mutations, she is at a very high risk of developing breast cancer.  There are \nfour instances in which a prophylactic mastectomy of either one or both breasts should \nbe carried out.  These are as follows:  \n\u2022 Strong family history of breast cancer  \n\u2022 Presence of inherited mutations in one of two breast cancer susceptibility genes \n(BRCA1 and BRCA2)  \n\u2022 Previous cancer in one breast  \n\u2022 Biopsies showing lobular carcinoma in situ and/or atypical hyperplasia of the breast.  \n \nAs we can see from the scenario, this patient ticks two out of the four boxes.  The next \nbest step for her would be a referral to a surgeon for a prophylactic mastectomy.  \n \nWomen aged 50 to 70 years old in England are offered mammograms every 3 years.  In \ncases like this patient where ther e is BRCA1 mutation, a mammogram would be offered \nannually from ages 40 to 69.  Since she just had it 6 months ago, it is not the right \nanswer.  The NHS takes breast cancer risk very seriously, and would take \nprecuationary steps such as organising MRI scan s of the breast annually as well as \nmammograms for those who have a BRCA1 mutation.  \n \nAn ultrasound of the breast is used in cases in which a breast lump is found during \nexamination of the breast.  \n \nA sentinel node biopsy isdone for the staging of cancers.  The sentinel lymph node is \nthe first lymph node or group of lymph nodes that drain a cancer site.  \n \nFine needle aspiration is done if a lump was found during breast examination.  It is done \nafter an ultrasound of the breast.  \n \nRemember, prophylactic bilateral mastectomies and prophylactic bilateral \noophorectomies can be offered in cases in which the patient has a strong family history \nof cancer and has genetic markers for the cancer."

			"answer": "Cut the subcutaneous sutures",
			"explanation": "This is a very common question in PLAB part 1. Once you do a few of these \nquestions,you would soon realise that you would be able to answer this question after \nreading thefirst sentence. Anyone with shortness of breath and stridor after a very \nrecentthyroidectomy needs their sutures cut.  \n \nA rare complication of thyroidectomy is upper airway obstruction secondar y \ntohaematoma. To prevent the airway from being totally occluded, it is necessary \ntoreleasethe pressure this haematoma is causing by loosening the tightness of the \ncompartmentin which it is building up. If this does not improve his breathing, this man \nwill very soonneed intubation. Whilst this is a rare scenario and not important per se , it \nis stillcommonly asked in exams.  \n \nAdrenaline \u2192 is used in anaphylaxis, which is a reasonable differential in stridor (due \ntolaryngoedema), but is less likely here than the local effects of the surgery.  \nLow molecular weight heparin \u2192 is the treatment for a pulmonary embolus, which \ndoescause sudden breathlessness, but not due to upper airway compromise.  \n \nOxygen \u2192 is a reasonable response to dropping SaO2 in someone with healthy lungs  \nbut is not the treatment that is going to arrest this man\u2019s upper airway occlusion.  \n \nSalbutamol Nebulizer \u2192 is useful to open smaller constricting airways (e.g. in asthma \norCOPD) but will not reduce the pressure effect of a haema toma on the trachea."

			"answer": "Cancer of the head of the pancreas",
			"explanation": "This patient has cancer of the head of the pancreas.  The initial signs and symptoms of \npancreatic cancer are often non -specific and patients will report anything from anorexia \nto mid -epigastric/back pain.  The pain for carcinoma of the head of pancreas is often \nvery vague and this stem portrays it well.  By the time of patient presentation, pancreatic \ncancer will have often spread to other parts of the body or the entirety of the pancreas.  \nThe clue that points to pancre atic cancer in this stem is the patient\u2019s drastic weight loss \nAND the elevation of her bilirubin levels as well as all of her liver enzymes.  \n \nLiver function tests are done in patients in whom pancreatic cancer is suspected to \nconfirm jaundice.  Liver funct ion tests will typically show an obstructive jaundice with \nraised bilirubin (conjugated and total) levels.  There will also be an increase in all other \nlive enzymes with alkaline phosphatase and gamma -glutamyl transferase being raised \nthe most, and asparta te transferase and alanine transferase being raised to a lesser \nextent.  The reason for an obstructive picture is because the tumour of the head of the \npancreas blocks the biliary tract.  \n \nThe palpable mass just beneath the liver described in this stem repr esents the \ngallbladder which is typically palpable in patients with carcinoma of the head of \npancreas.  \n \nOther subtle hints that point towards pancreatic cancer is the more than average alcohol \nintake and smoking which are risk factors.  It is important to note that alcohol does not \nappear to be an independent risk factor but alcohol is a risk factor towards chronic \npancreatitis which may lead to pancreatic cancer.  \n \nCholangiocarcinoma are rare adenocarcinomas of the biliary tract often presents with \nabdomina l pain mostly localised to the right upper quadrant.  The triad of \ncholangiocarcinoma is jaundice, right upper quadrant pain and weight loss.  Right upper \nquadrant pain is the main differentiating feature in this stem of cholangiocarcinoma from \npancreatic cancer since the liver function tests of cholangiocarcinoma may be similar to \nthe liver function test results of pancreatic cancer.  \n \nPANCREATIC CANCER  \n60% of pancreatic tumours are adenocarcinomas which typically occur at the head of \nthepancreas.  \n \nAssociat ions \n- Smoking  \n- Diabetes  \n- Chronic pancreatitis  \n \nFeatures  Tumours in the head of pancreas  \n\u2022 Obstructive jaundice \u2192 dark urine, pale stools and pruritus  \n\u2022 May be painless although around 70% are associated with epigastric or left upper \nquadrant pain radiating to the back which may be vague  \n \nTumours in body or tail of pancreas  \n\u2022 Epigastric pain which radiates to the back and relieved by sitting forward  \n \nEither tumour in head or body/tail may cause:  \n\u2022 Anorexia, weight loss  \n\u2022 Atypical abdominal pain  \n \nInvestiga tion \n\u2022 CA 19 -9 is non specific but helps assess prognosis  \n\u2022 Transabdominal u ltrasound has a sensitivity of around 60 -90% \n\u2022 High resolution CT scanning is the investigation of choice  \n \nManagement  \n\u2022 Whipple's resection (pancreaticoduodenectomy) is considered in fit patients with no \nmetastasis  \n\u2022 ERCP with stenting is often used for palliation"

			"explanation": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder.  This means that the parents of \nthe cystic fibrosis child are carriers.   \n \nIf a child is born to parents who carry the same autosomal recessive change (mutation), \nthe child has a 1 in 4 chance of inh eriting the abnormal gene from both parents and \ndeveloping the disease.  The child would have a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting one \nabnormal gene.  This would make him/her a carrier.  \n \nGENETIC INHERITANCE REVIEW BEFORE THE EXAM  It is worth remembering all the common genetic diseases and how they are passed on \nto their offspring.  This page should be reviewed just before going for the exam to \nrefresh your memory.  \n \nAutosomal recessive  \nChild has 25% chance of inheriting the genetic condition if  BOTH parents are carriers of \nthe faulty gene.  \n\u2022 Cystic fibrosis  \n\u2022 Sickle cell anaemia  \n\u2022 Thalassaemia  \n \nAutosomal dominant  \nChild has 50% chance of inheriting the genetic condition if ONE parent has the \nmutation.  \n\u2022 Huntington  \n\u2022 Neurofibromatosis  \n\u2022 Autosomal dominant pol ycystic kidney disease  \n \nX-linked dominant  \nChild has a 50% chance of inheriting the genetic condition if MOTHER has the mutation \n(MOTHER would also be affected by the disorder).  Female child has a 100% chance of \ninheriting the genetic condition and male ch ild has 0% chance of inheriting the genetic \ncondition if FATHER has the mutation (FATHER would be affected by the disorder).  \n\u2022 Fragile X syndrome  \nIf you google image Fragile X syndrome, you would realise that all the pictures are \nof male children.  Why are t he features of Fragile X -syndrome seen more in males \neven though females are more often affected (an X -linked dominant condition)? \nThis is because males display a complete penetrance and therefore almost always \ndisplay symptoms of Fragile X syndrome howeve r females display penetrance of \nabout 50% as a result of having a second normal X -chromosome and so they have \nsymptoms that are less severe than males.  \n \nX-linked recessive  \nMale child has a 50% chance of inheriting the genetic condition if MOTHER is a carrier.  \nFemale child has a 50% chance of becoming a carrier if MOTHER is a carrier.

There areseveral well \nknown associations with the development of acute leukaemiathat are sometimes \npresent. These include radiation exposure,chemotherapeutic agents, as well as some \nretroviruses.  \n \nClinical Presentati on \nThe most common presentation results from the effects of the leukaemicblast cells \ncrowding out the normal marrow cells, resulting in symptoms ofpancytopenia even if the \ntotal white blood cell count is normal.  \n\u2022 Fatigue from anaemia is the most common pr esenting complaint.  \n\u2022 Bleeding, petechiae, purpura or ecchymoses (due tothrombocytopenia)  \n\u2022 Recurrent and severe infections (oral, throat, skin, perianalinfections commonly). This  \nis because of the underproduction orabnormal function of white blood cells.  \n\u2022 Left upper quadrant fullness and early satiety due to splenomegaly(10 -20%)  \n \nAcute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) is more common in children, and \nacutemyelogenous leukaemia (AML) is more common in adults, but they \nareindistinguishable clinically.

However, none of these \nwill have leuka emic blastscirculating in the peripheral blood. Although pancytopenia can \ncause all ofthe above, in PLAB, when pancytopenia is in the options, it is \nusuallyleukaemia, or aplastic anaemia.  \n \nA bone marrow biopsy showing numerous blasts confirms the diagnosis  ofacute \nleukaemia.  \n It is very unlikely that the PLAB questions would ask you to differentiate theAML from \nALL using specific test. However, if a child (young age) is givenwith signs and \nsymptoms of pancytopenia, ALL would be the most likely asit is the c ommonest \nchildhood leukaemia.  \n \nNote:  \n\u2022 ALL is the commonest childhood leukaemia.

			"answer": "Direct antiglobulin test",
			"explanation": "This patient has a haemolytic anaemia.  A direct antiglobulin test is a synonym for a \ndirect Coombs test.  \n \nThe direct Coombs test is used to test for autoimmune haemolytic anaemia or in other \nwords any condition of an anaemia caused by immune system lysis or destruction of red blood cells.  \n \nSome examples of diseases that test positive for a direct Coombs test i nclude \nalloimmune haemolysis (such as Rhesus disease), autoimmune haemoloysis (such as \nsystemic lupus erythematosus) or drug -induced immune -mediated haemolysis.  \n \nThe term \u201cpolychramasia\u201d used in this stem refers to a disorder where there is an \nabnormally h igh amount of immature red blood cells.  A haemolytic anaemia such as \nthis case (or any other form of anaemia) would trigger erythropoeitin release and \nincrease the rate of which red blood cells are produced and released from the bone \nmarrow.  When levels of erythropoeitin are high, immature red cells would be released \ninto the bloodstream.  \n \nCOOMBS TEST  \nThere are two Coombs tests:  \n1. The direct Coombs test (DCT, also known as direct antiglobulin test  or DAT)  \n2. The indirect Coombs test (also known as indirect antiglobulin test or  IAT) \n \nDirect Coombs test  \n\u2022 Used to test for autoimmune haemolytic anaemia  \n\u2022 It is used to detect these antibodies or complement  proteins that are bound to the  \n  surface of red blood cells.   Basically, it is used to test patients RED BLOOD \nCELLS.  \n\u2022 A positive Coombs test indicates that an immune  mechanism is attacking the \npatient's  \n  own RBCs. Examples:  \n\u2022 Common examples of alloimmune haemolysis  \no Haemolytic disease of the newborn (also  known as HDN or erythroblastosis \nfetalis)  \no Rh D haemolytic disease of the newborn  (also known as Rh disease)  \no ABO haemolytic disease of the newborn  \no Alloimmune haemolytic transfusion  reactions  \n\u2022 Common examples of autoimmune haemolysis  \no Cold agglutinin disease : Infectious  mononucleosis  \n\u2022 Drug -induced immune -mediated hemolysis  \no Penicillins, Cephalosporins  \n \nIndirect Coombs test  \n\u2022 Used in prenatal testing of pregnant women and in testing blood  prior to a blood  \n  transfusion . \n\u2022 It detects antibodies against RBCs that are present unbound  in the patient's serum. \nIn this case, serum is extracted from  the blood sample taken from the patient and \ntested.   Basically, it is used to test patients SERUM (not red blood  \ncells)  \n\u2022 If agglutination occurs, the indirect Coombs test is positive.  \n\u2022 Examples of use:  o Blood transfusion preparation : Antibody  screening, cross matching  \no Antenatal antibody screening: to screen  pregnant women for IgG antibodies \nthat are likely to pass through the placenta into  the fetal blood and cause \nhaemolytic  disease of the newborn  \n \nDirect Coombs test  Indirect Coombs test  \nTests a patient\u2019s RED BLOOD CELLS  \n \nHow the test works:  \n1.  Blood sample is taken  \n2. The RBCs are washed (patient\u2019s plasma is \nremoved)  \n3. RBCs are incubated with anti -human globulin \n(Coombs reagent)  \n \n4. If this produces agglutination of RBCs, the \ndirect Coombs test is positive.  \n5. A positive Coombs test indicates that an \nimmune mechanism is attacking the patient\u2019s \nown RBCs  Tests a patient\u2019s SERUM  \n \nHow the test works  \n1. Blood sample is taken  \n2.

			"explanation": "Before looking at the cell types, think of the diagnosis.  The most likely diagnosis here is \nAcute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) as he is young, suffering recurrent infections (due \nto abnormal WBCs), and having pale conjunctiva (anaemia).  The bleeding gums and \nnosebleeds tell you that he has thrombocy topaenia.  \n \nAcute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) both have \nnumerous blast cells.  \n \nAcute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)  \n \nAetiology  Most cases of acute leukaemia arise with no apparent cause. There are  several well \nknown associations with the development of acute leukaemia that are sometimes \npresent. These include radiation exposure,  chemotherapeutic agents, as well as some \nretroviruses.  \n \nClinical Presentation  \nThe most common presentation results from the effects of the le ukaemic  blast cells \ncrowding out the normal marrow cells, resulting in symptoms of  pancytopenia even if \nthe total white blood cell count is normal.  \n\u2022 Fatigue from anaemia is the most common presenting complaint.  \n\u2022 Bleeding, petechiae, purpura or ecchymoses  (due to  thrombocytopenia)  \n\u2022 Recurrent and severe infections (oral, throat, skin, perianal  infections commonly). This  \n  is because of the underproduction or  abnormal function of white blood cells.  \n\u2022 Left upper quadrant fullness and early satiety due to sp lenomegaly  (10-20%)  \n \nAcute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) is more common in children, and acute  \nmyelogenous leukaemia (AML) is more common in adults, but they are  indistinguishable \nclinically. This means you cannot determine the diagnosis  only from the clinical \npresentation.  \n \nALL is more often associated with infiltration of other organs, but AML can  do it as well. \nEnlargement of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes and bone  pain are common at \npresentation.  \n \nDiagnosis  \nThe FBC is the first clue to the diagnosis. Depression of all three cell lines is  \ncommon at presentation.  \n \nFBC \n\u2022 Anaemia is usual and Hb may be below 5 g/L  \n\u2022 The white cell count can be low, normal, or elevated  \n\u2022 Thrombocytopenia  \n \nMany other disorders can present as pancytopenia similar t o leukaemia  such as aplastic \nanaemia, infections involving the marrow, metastatic  cancer involving the marrow, \nvitamin B12 deficiency, SLE, hypersplenism,  and myelofibrosis. However, none of these \nwill have leukaemic blasts  circulating in the peripheral bl ood. Although pancytopenia \ncan cause all of  the above, in PLAB, when pancytopenia is in the options, it is usually  \nleukaemia, or aplastic anaemia.  \n \nA bone marrow biopsy showing numerous blasts confirms the diagnosis of  acute \nleukaemia.  \n \nIt is very unlikely  that the PLAB questions would ask you to differentiate the AML from \nALL using specific test. However, if a child (young age) is given with signs and symptoms of pancytopenia, ALL would be the most likely as it is the commonest \nchildhood leukaemia.  \n \nNote:  \n\u2022 ALL is the commonest childhood leukaemia. Peak age is 2 \u20134 years old.  \n\u2022 The Philadelphia chromosome occurs in 15 \u201330% (mostly adults) and is associated \nwith a poor prognosis."

			"explanation": "Most cases of haemolytic uremic syndrome develop in children after 2 to 14  days of \ndiarrhoea often bloody, due to infection with a certain strain of E.  coli. Common features \ninclude abdominal pain, fever, features of renal  failure like nausea/vomiting can also \noccur.   \n \nRenal function and  electrolytes would show a rise in urea and creatinine.   This is due to \ndehydration but, if associated with haemolysis and  thrombocytopenia, then it would \nindicate the onset of HUS.  \n \nA brief description:  \n \n \nHenoch -Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP) Vs Haemolytic uraem ic syndrome (HUS) Vs  \nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)  \n \nHenoch -Scholein Purpura  Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome  Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura  \n- Purpura  \n- Abdomnial pain  \n- Arthritis  \n- Glomerulonephritis  \n- Periarticular disease  \n- Periarticular oedema  \n \nFeatures of IgA nephropathy may \noccur e.g. haematuria, renal \nfailure  \n Triad  \n1.

This produces a verotoxin that  attacks \nendothelial cells. Occurs after eating undercooked contaminated  meat.  \n \nSigns and Symptoms : \nThe classical presenting feature is profuse diarrhoea that turns bloo dy 1 to 3  days later. \nIt is rare for the diarrhoea to have been bloody from the outset.   About 80 -90% of \nchildren from whom the organism is isolated will develop  blood in the stool. It is usually \nat this stage that they are admitted to  hospital.  \n \nMost adul ts infected with E. coli O157 remain asymptomatic.  \n \nThere is often fever, abdominal pain and vomiting  \n \nManagement  \n\u2022 Treatment is supportive e.g. Fluids, blood transfusion and dialysis if  required  \n\u2022 Do not give antibiotics to those with possible HUS.

They are  neither symptomati c nor anaemic,  \n  but may have mild  splenomegaly, slight reticulocytosis and minimal spherocytes   \n  visible.  \n\u2022 60-70% of patients have moderate disease and half of these present  in childhood with  \n  anaemia.  \n\u2022 Neonates with severe hereditary disease do not always present at  birth with anaemia,  \n  but haemoglobin may fall dramatically over the  first few weeks of life and may be  \n  severe enough to require  exchange transfusion.  \n\u2022 Occasional aplastic crises occur, e.g. with parvovirus B19 infection.   \nDiagno sis \n(These are the 3 most important test that you need to know in the exam for  Hereditary \nSpherocytosis)  \n\u2022 Blood film shows spherocytes and increased reticulocytes  \n\u2022 MCHC would be elevated  \n\u2022 Osmotic fragility test \u2192 confirms presence of spherocytes but doe s not permit  \n  hereditary spherocytosis to be distinguished from other  spherocytic haemolytic  \n  disorders such as autoimmune haemolytic  anaemia. This is not reliable until six  \n  months of age.  \n \nSome authors mention that osmotic fragility test is unreliable and is  no longer \nrecommended. However, it is still considered the gold  standard despite missing up to \n20% of cases. In the PLAB exam,  osmotic fragility test may be given as a choice for a \ndiagnostic test  for Hereditary Spherocytosis. Pick it if it is. \n \nNote:  \nSpherocytosis almost always refers to hereditary spherocytosis but note  that \nspherocytes are found in hereditary spherocytosis and also  autoimmune haemolytic \nanaemias. The test to distinguish the two would be  a direct Coombs test. Hereditary \nspherocytosis has a negative direct  Coombs test but autoimmune haemolytic anaemias \nhave a positive direct  Coombs test  \n \n \n \nManagement  \nSteroid therapy  \n\u2022 effective in augmenting haemoglobin levels during haemolytic  crises in patients with  \n  moderate disease  \nFolate supplementation  \n \nSplenectomy  \n\u2022 eliminates anaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia and lowers the high  reticulocyte number  \n  to nearly normal levels  \n\u2022 Splenectomy is curative in most patients but increased recogni tion of the long -term  \n  risks of splenectomy has led to re -evaluation of the  role of splenectomy.  \n \nMild cases do not usually require folate supplements or splenectomy  \n \nComplications  \n\u2022 Rapid haemolysis can be triggered by viral infections and produce  jaundice, anaemia  \n  and occasionally abdominal pain and tender  splenomegaly. Supportive treatment is  \n  usually all that is needed.  \n\u2022 Aplastic crises (aplastic anaemia). They are most commonly caused  by infection with  \n  parvovirus B19 and usually  last 10 -14 days. This  can be life -threatening.  \n \nWhen you see parvovirus B19 in the exam, immediately think of sickle cell  anaemia or \nhereditary spherocytosis  \n \nParvovirus and anaemia  \nAlthough most patients have a decrease of erythropoiesis (production of  red blood cells) \nduring parvovirus infection, it is most dangerous in patients  with sickle cell anaemia or \nhereditary spherocytosis, as they are heavily  dependent on erythropoiesis due to the \nreduced lifespan of the red cells."

Usually primaquine is the \nculprit.  \n \nGlucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency  \nGlucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is X -linked and  clinically \nimportant cause of oxidant haemolysis. It affects all races but is  most common in those \nof African, Asian or Mediterranean descent.  \n \nDeficiency of the G6PD enzyme results in redu ced glutathione making the  red cells \nvulnerable to oxidative damage and thus liable to haemolysis.   \n \n\u2193 G6PD enzyme \u2192 \u2193 glutathione \u2192 \u2191 red cell susceptibility to oxidative  stress  \n \u2022 Being X -linked, the disease affects mainly men but in areas of high frequency it is \nnot uncommon to find homozygous women.

			"explanation": "This is actually an acute emergency. The leucocytosis is causing the bone  pain. \nBleeding from the gum is commonly seen in acute myeloid leukaemia  \n(AML).  \nNote that gum bleeding can also be seen in ALL.  \n \nAML is the most common acute leukaemia in adults. Thus, majority of the  acute \nleukaemia in children questions asked in the PLAB test would be  acute lymphobl astic \nleukaemia (ALL) and not acute myeloid leukaemia  (AML).  \n \nOne needs to be careful with picking AML or ALL as there are often questions with a \nvery similar stem. In reality, it is difficult to diagnose them clinically as well. Flow \ncytometry (immunophen otyping) is used to help distinguish AML from acute lymphocytic \nleukemia (ALL).  \n \nAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML)  \nThis neoplastic proliferation of blast cells is derived from marrow myeloid elements. It \nprogresses rapidly (death in about 2 months if untreated )  \n \nChildren or young adults may present with acute symptoms over a few days  to a few \nweeks.  \n \nMost AML subtypes show more than 30% blasts of a myeloid lineage in the  \nblood, bone marrow, or both.  \n \nPresentation:  \n\u2022 Fatigue, pallor, dizziness and shortness of breath on exertion  (symptoms of anaemia)  \n\u2022 Bleeding caused by thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia often  causes petechiae on  \n  the lower limbs. DIC may aggravate the  situation and cause larger lesions  \n\u2022 Infection  \n\u2022 Gingivitis is common, with sw ollen, bleeding gums  \n\u2022 There can also be bone pain  \u2022 Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly may be found.

However, it may also be  normal or even low  \n\u2022 Neutrophils are usually de pleted and blast cells are seen in  their place  \n\u2022 Bone marrow aspiration is the diagnostic procedure.

The fact that \nplatelets and white cell counts are within the normal range  suggest a secondary cause \nrather than polycythaemia rubra vera.

An MRI head reveals multiple ring shaped contrast enhancing \nlesions.  What is the SINGLE most likely causative organism?",

			"b": "Streptococcus",
			"c": "Toxoplasma  gondii",
			"d": "Herpes simplex virus",
			"e": "Pneumocystis jirovecii",
			"answer": "Toxoplasma gondii",
			"explanation": "The symptoms and MRI findings here are highly suggestive of toxoplasmosis, a disease  \ncaused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii.  \n \nThe reason behind the HIV history is that toxoplasmosis can reactivate in those with  \nsevere HIV disease when their CD4 counts are very low ( <50 -100/\u03bcL).  \n \nPrinciple Manifestations usually include a brain mass lesion, headache, confusion,  \nseizures, and focal neurologic deficits. These symptoms occur due to increased \nintracranial pressure.  In patients with AIDS, cerebral toxoplasmosis should be right at \nthe top of the list of differentials if one presents with focal neurological symptoms.  \nImaging such as CT or MRI scan of the head w ould show a \"ring\" (contrast) enhancing \nlesion with  oedema .  Scans may show solitary lesions or cortical atrophy.  Given the \nchoice of imaging modality, choose an MRI over a CT as MRI appears to be more \nsensitive than CT in imaging for cerebral toxoplasmos is. \n \nTOXOPLASMOSIS  \nToxoplasma gondii is a protozoa which infects the body via the gastrointestinal tract, \nlung or broken  skin.  Human infection occurs from consumption of undercooked meat \nor, foot or water contaminated with the oocytes.  It's oocysts release trophozoites which \nmigrate widely around the body including  to the eye, brain and muscle. The usual \nanimal reservoir is cat s where oocytes are produced in the cat\u2019s intestines and shed in \nits faeces.  \n \nInterestingly, toxoplasma gondii is known to remove rats\u2019 fear of cats.  Somehow \ninfected rats are mildly attracted to the odour of cats which uninfected rats would usually \nrun away from.  This is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation to help toxoplasma \ngondii complete its life cycle: rats are exposed to cat faeces and are infected with \ntoxoplasma gondii.  They then lose their innate fear of cats and are more likely to be \neaten by cats.  Toxoplasmosis then sexually reproduces in the rat\u2019s gut.  This brings \nnew meaning to the term \u201cEat PrEy, Love\u201d.  \n \nMost infections are asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients usually have a self -limiting  \ninfection, often having clinical features resem bling infectious mononucleosis (fever,  \nmalaise, lymphadenopathy). Other less common manifestations include  \nmeningoencephalitis and myocarditis.  \n \nTreatment:  \nPyrimethamine plus sulphadiazine"

			"a": "Unconjugated bilirubin",
			"b": "Paul Bunnell test",
			"c": "Blood and urine culture and sensitivity",
			"d": "CSF analysis",
			"e": "ELISA for IgM antibodies",
			"answer": "Blood and urine culture and sensitivity",
			"explanation": "This patient is suffering from leptospirosis.  Leptospirosis is the most widespread \nzoonotic infection worldwide.  The main risk factor for acquiring the infection is direct or \nindirect contact with the urine of infected animals.  Contact can occur secondary to \noccupational exposure or accidentally via exposure to unclean sources of water.  \nTravelers and athletes participating in water sports, such as those who compete in \ntriathlons, represent a growing population at risk.  In the UK, ask for a history of rowing, \nfishing, contact with animals or travel.  The red discoloration of the eye seen initially is \nsubconjunctival haemorrhage which occurs in more than 90% of patients with \nleptospirosis.  Aminotransferase levels are usually ele vated but they are rarely higher \nthan 200 U/L just as seen in this stem.   \n \nThe single most appropriate investigation in this scenarior would be blood and urine cultures.  This is because leptospirosis can be isolated from blood during the initial \nphase fo r the first seven to ten days of the disease.  Leptospirosis also can be isolated \nfrom urine but this usually occurs in the second stage called \u201cleptospiruric phase\u201d which \nusually occurs after 7 days.  \n \nA CSF analysis is a logical test to do as well however , a CSF analysis would show \nlymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated proteins which are not specifically diagnostic for \nleptospirosis however it can also be cultures to show evidence of leptospirosis.  \nNonetheless, a blood culture should be prioritised.  \n \nELISA  for IgM antibodies is not the correct option.  IgM antibodies can only be detected \nafter the fifth day of illness.  ELISA for IgM antibodies can be done after day 5 of patient \npresentation, however it is not the most appropriate test to be done right now.  \n \nThe Paul Bunnell test or the monospot test is a form of the heterophile antibody test.  It \nis a rapid test for infectious mononucleosis due to the Epstein -Barr virus (EBV).  This \nchoice is therefore incorrect.  \n \nRemember, dark -field examination of blood, urine or CSF can demonstrate leptospira.  \nOrganisms can be isolated from blood and CSF in the first week of illness and can be \nisolated in urine samples from 7 days to a month from initial illness.  \n \nMost cases of leptospirosis present as mild, self -limitin g, nonspecific febrile illness.  If \ntreatment is needed oral doxycycline can be prescribed for mild disease.  IF there is \nsevere disease then ampicillin or benzylpenicillin."

In this case, reassurance is all  that is \nneeded. Mumps is a self limiting condition.  \n Mumps  \n\u2022 Mumps is an acute, generalised infection caused by a paramyxovirus, usually in   \n  children and young adults  \n\u2022 It can infect any organ but  usually affects the salivary glands  \n\u2022 The virus is highly infectious with transmission by droplets spread in saliva via   close  \n  personal contact  \n\u2022 Infected persons excrete the virus for several days before symptoms appear  and for  \n  several days afterwa rds \n \nPresentation  \n\u2022 Mumps can be asymptomatic  \n\u2022 Nonspecific symptoms lasting a few days, such as fever, headache, malaise,  myalgia  \n  and anorexia, can precede parotitis  \n\u2022 Parotitis is usually bilateral although it can be unilateral  \n\u2022 Typically, there is p ain at or near the angle of the jaw  \n\u2022 Fever may be as high as 39.5\u00b0C without rigors in small children  \n\u2022 Swelling causes distortion of the face and neck with skin over the gland hot and   \n  flushed but there is no rash  \n\u2022 With severe swelling, the mouth cannot be opened and is dry because the  salivary  \n  ducts are blocked.  \n\u2022 Discomfort lasts for three or four days but may be prolonged when one side  clears and  \n  the other side swells.  \n\u2022 Usually just the parotid glands are involved but, rarely, the submaxi llary and  sublingual  \n  salivary glands are affected  \n \nOrchitis  \nOrchitis may occur four or five days after the start of parotitis but it often appears  \nwithout it. This can sometimes lead to the diagnosis being missed. Orchitis presents  \nwith chills, sweats, headache and backache with swinging temperature and severe local  \ntesticular pain and tenderness. The scrotum is swollen and oedematous so that the  \ntestes are impalpable.  \nOrchitis is usually unilateral but may be bilateral."

But the more importan t action is to start PEP as this can \nsignificantly change the outcome of the incident.  \n \nThe police officer will also require follow up serology blood tests at 6 weeks, 3 months \nand 6 months.  \n \nAll human bites should be treated with a 7 day course of oral co -amoxiclav.  If the \npatient has a penicillin allergy, metronidazole plus doxycycline, erythromycin or \nclarithromycin.  \n \nHe has had a tetanus booster within the last 5 years and therefore a further booster is \nnot required.  \n \nEXAMPLE OF POST EXPOSURE PR OPHYLAXIS (PEP) RISK ASSESSMENT  \nThis is an example of how Emergency Departments would perform risk assessment for \npatients who may require PEP.

He coughed up about a teaspoon of fresh blood this morning \nand he coughed up a few drops on his way to the hospital.  He has had no other \nepisodes of haemoptysis in  the past.  Upon further questioning, it is revealed that \nhe has had a chronic cough for the past two months.  He has no history of recent \ntravel outside of the United Kingdom.  He drinks alcohol socially and smokes \naround four cigarettes a day.  He admits  to smoking marijuana occasionally with \nhis friends.  The patient works as a packer in a busy loading bay for a large \nmanufacturing company.  He is extremely nervous and thinks that he might have \ncancer as he read on the internet that one of the symptoms o f cancer is the \ncoughing up of blood.  Upon physical examination, the patient looks unwell and \ncachectic.  Dullness to percussion can be appreciated over the right upper zone \nof his chest.  A chest X -ray reveals right upper lobe consolidation with a bilate ral \npleural effusion.  What is the SINGLE most appropriate investigation for this \npatient?",
			"a": "Blood culture for cytomegalovirus (CMV)",

			"d": "Aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures  E. Pleural tap",
			"e": "None",

			"explanation": "Clues that point to tuberculosis in this stem are cachexic, chronic cough, haemoptysis.  \nThe chest X -ray findings are also consistent with tuberculosis.   In tuberculosis, the chest \nX-rays usually show upper lobe infiltrates with cavitation.  \n \nAlthough marijuana is in the stem, smoking marijuana is not an independent risk factor \nfor developing tuberculosis.  \n \nThe patient would be asked to produce 3 samples of a deep cough sputum (with at lea st \n1 early morning sample) and these are sent away for acid fast staining and culture.  \n \nPleural aspiration as a diagnostic procedure is usually performed in unilateral pleural \neffusions where there is diagnostic uncertainty.

She has a temperature of 38.9 C, a respiratory rate of 28 \nbreaths/minute and a heart r ate of 110 beats/minute.  What is the SINGLE most \nappropriate action?  \n \nANSWER:  \nIntravenous antibiotics, incision and drainage  \n \nEXPLANATION:  \nSuperficial neck abscesses are usually the result of an infection in a lymph node in the  \nneck (lymphadenitis) turning into an abscess. Staphylococcus aureus is usually the  \nculprit. Antibiotics can initially be given and if the abscess does not resolve then it may  \nneed to be drained. However, given this stem, it is clear that she is unwell and possi bly \nseptic and thus oral antibiotics would not be a good option here. Antibiotics need to be  \ngiven intravenously, and the abscess needs to be drained.  \n \nMost cases of neck abscess require patients to be hospitalized and intravenous  \nantibiotics to be given. Analgesia is also important to relieve pain from the abscess but  \nthe option to give oral antibiotics in combination with pain relief is an incorrect one in a  \nscenario where the patient is potentially septic.  \n \nDraining of a superficial neck abscess is a sim ple procedure and is done under general  \nanesthesia. Incision and drainage is important as the pus sample collected from the  \ndrainage is sent to the laboratory for culture and sensitivity. After the organism is  \nidentified, specific antibiotics can be used a ccordingly.  \n Q-58 \nA 38 year old female, 32 weeks pregnant presents with thick white marks on the \ninside of her mouth for 3 weeks.

			"a": "Lichen planus",
			"b": "Aphthous ulcer",
			"c": "Molluscum contagiosum",
			"d": "Candidiasis",
			"e": "Leukoplakia",
			"answer": "Candidiasis",
			"explanation": "Smokers are more likely to develop oral thrush.  The history of pregnancy is not too \nrelevant.  But the idea that the question writers want to portray is that in pregnancy,  the \nimmune system is weakened. Thus candidiasis is more likely.  \n \nLichen planus may have lace like appearance and not thick white mark like in this case.    \n \nAphthous ulcer is typically round or oval sores or ulcers inside the mouth.    \n \nMolluscum contagiosum present as firm, smooth, umbilicated papules on the trunk or  \nextremities and not in the mouth like in the given stem.  \n \nLeukoplakia is an option but it is less likely that oral candidiasis. They may sometimes  \ngive a history of a white lesion in the mouth that cannot be rubbed off."

			"d": "Schistosomiasis",
			"e": "Ebola",
			"answer": "Malaria",
			"explanation": "This is a very interesting question with a huge debate between Malaria and  \nSchistosomiasis.  \n \nInitially, one may pick Schistosomiasis as Schistosomiasis is widely distributed in udan \nwith more than 5 million people, mostly children, requiring treatment. 5 weeks  here fits \nthe timeline of schistosomiasis as symptoms usually takes from four to six  weeks from \nthe time of infection. They may feel generally unwell at this point however  in majority of \ncases blood in the urin e only occurs somewhere between 10 to 12 weeks  after the \ninfection. The blood in urine is due to the worms of Schistosoma  haematobium \nmigrating to the veins around the bladder and ureters.  \n \nFurthermore, one must remember that bladder involvement is caused by Schistosoma  \nhaematobium while Schistosoma mansoni is mainly responsible for intestinal forms of  \ndisease. Hepatomegaly is not a clinical feature of infection with Schistosoma  \nhaematobium (which causes the bloody urine). It can be seen in infections with  \nSchistosoma mansoni but again these are two different infections. Infections with  Schistosoma mansoni does not cause bloody urine.  \n \nIn short, a patient suffering from urinary schistosomiasis (caused by Schistosoma  \nhaematobium) will develop terminal haematu ria, while another patient infected with  \nSchistosoma mansoni may develop hepatomegaly but ultimately these symptoms are  \ncaused by different species.  \n \nConsidering the clinical features, the best answer is Malaria. Blackwater fever is a  \ncomplication of malar ia infection in which red blood cells burst in the bloodstream  \n(haemolysis), releasing hemoglobin directly into the blood vessels and into the urine.   \nThis accounts for the dark urine. Malaria is also known to cause hepatomegaly."

These are serology tests.  Some GUM \nclinics perform microscope or laboratory test on a skin ulcer sample if the ulcer is \npresent however the most important test for syphilis is carried out on a blood sample.  \n \nPolymerase chain reaction ( PCR) or dark field microscopy can only be carried out from \na sample of the lesion or an infected lymph node.  Since the ulcer is healed, a sample \ncannot be obtained.  \n \nIf there was an ulcer visible, a dark field microscopy would allow a point of care syphilis \ndiagnosis. The GUM physician would visualize the live treponemes, obtained from a \nvariety of cutaneous or mucous membrane lesions while in the clinic and could trea t the \npatient right there and then.  This obviously has a huge advantage.  However if the patient presents to a GP surgery, a PCR would be performed as GPs do not have \nfacilities or capabilites to perform a dark field microscopy.  So the answer for most \nappropriate investigations of syphilis if a patient presents with an ulcer would depend on \nwhich type of clinic he visits \u2013 a GP surgery or a GUM clinic.  \n \nA midstream urine sample would detect a urinary tract infection, not a sexual \ntransmitted disease."

The reason for consent is to ensure that the patient is \ngiven appropriate information about the implications of the test if they come back \npositive.   \n \nThe patient is considered low risk, therefore post -exposure prophylaxis is not necessary \nfor the surgeon.  \n \nIn this case, hepatitis B surface antigen blood test for the surgeon would suffice.  \nHepatitis C virus and HIV antibodies are usually not indicated at time of injury as it takes \ntime for the antibodies to develop if the surgeon gets infected.  The serum is stored for \nfuture use if required.  \n \nAdditional information:  The surgeon should return in 6 weeks for a full set of seroloogy \nwhich now incudes hepatitis C virus and HIV antibodies.  If this comes back negative, \nand the patient\u2019s initial blood test was also negative, the surgeon can be disch arged with no further follow up.

Myogloglbin has heme which results in a posit ive \ndipstick for blood.  Myoglobin is nephrotoxic and can cause a worsening acute kidney \ninjury.  It is important to rehydrate the patient to decrease the duration of contact \nbetween myoglobin and the kidney tubules.  \n \nRHABDOMYOLYSIS  \nRhabdomyolysis results from skeletal muscle breakdown, with release of its contents \ninto the circulation, including myoglobin, potassium, phosphate, urate and creatinine \nkinase (CK).  \n \nAetiology  \n\u2022 Suden, severe crush injury  \n\u2022 Status epilepticus  \n\u2022 Severe exertion  \n \nImportant presentations to remember for the exam  \n\u2022 Elderly patient with history of fall followed by long duration on the floor  \n\u2022 Mountain biker rescued from being trapped under heavy rocks for many hours  \n\u2022 Trapped under a fallen wardrobe for several hours  \u2022 IV drug user fou nd on floor not moving for a few days  \n\u2022 Marathon runner who just completed a long -distance run  \nTwo complications you need to remember for rhabdomyolysis  \n\u2022 Acute kidney injury  \n\u2022 Hyperkalaemia  \n \nThere is often enough pigment release in the bloodstream to cause neph rotoxicity. The \ndegree of toxicity is related to the duration of contact of the tubular cells with myoglobin.  \nThis toxicity is compounded by dehydration as well.  Example, a person who has run a \nmarathon has both myoglobin release as well as poor kidney p erfusion.  Both \ndehydration and release of myoglobin increase the risk of acute kidney injury.  \n \nOne of the most important complications to recognise for rhabdomyolysis is \nhyperkalaemia and thus rhabdomyolysis is often a medical emergency.  \n \nLaboratory testing  \nThe most important test when there has been a severe crush injury and the  \nrhabdomyolysis is potentially life threatening is an ECG or potassium level.  \n \nThis implies that you know how a patient with rhabdomyolysis will die. Acidosis and  \nhyperkalemia can lead to an arrhythmia. If there are peaked T -waves on the ECG, you  \nwill give calcium chloride or calcium gluconate.  \n \nThe best initial test that is specific for rhabdomyolysis is a urinalysis in which you find a  \ndipstick that is positive fo r blood but in which no red cells are seen. This is a False +ve  \ndipstick haematuria. This is because myoglobin can react with the reagent on the  \ndipstick and come out as if there were red cells present. Hemoglobin will do the same  \nthing. The dipstick of th e urinalysis cannot distinguish among hemoglobin, myoglobin,  \nand red blood cells. This is because myoglobin has heme in it.  \n \nRhabdomyolysis is confirmed with a markedly elevated serum CPK level. Elevated  \nserum  CPK is a biochemical marker of skeletal muscle  neurosis.  \n \nRhabdomyolysis is associated with a very rapidly rising creatinine level. This is because  \nof both renal failure as well as the massive release of muscle products.  \n \nTreatment  \n\u2022 Calcium chloride /gluconate.  \no If there are ECG abnormalities from the hyperkalaemia the best initial therapy is \ncalcium chloride or gluconate  \n\u2022 Intravenous fluid rehydration  \no Priority to prevent AKI.  \no This decreases the duration of contact between the nephrotoxic myoglobin and \nthe kidney tubule.  \n\u2022 Intraveno us sodium bicarbonate  \no Used to alkalinize urine to pH >6.5, to stabilize a less toxic form of myoglobin  \no Alkalinizing the urine with bicarbonate may help prevent the precipitation of the \npigment in the tubule  \n\u2022 Dialysis  \no Only needed  in severe cases"

			"explanation": "This acute kidney injury and hydronephrosis are indicative of an obstructive uropathy.  \nPercutaneous nephrostomy would be the best intervention to temporarily decompress \nthe renal collecting system.  \n \nESWL becomes extremely less effective once the stone goes upto 2 -3 mm in size.  \nLess than 50% chance of success.  This patient has AK I, a very large stone which is \nclearly obstructive uropathy, and therefore urgent percutaneous nephrostomy is \nindicated.  \n \nPERCUTANEOUS NEPHROSTOMY  \nThis is used as a temporary relief of ureteric obstruction where ureteric stones fail to  \nrespond to analgesic s and where renal function is impaired due to the stone. It is an  \nintervention that decompresses the renal collecting system by placing a catheter,  \nthrough the skin, into the kidney, under local anaesthetic. This catheter allows the urine  \nto drain from the  kidney into a collecting bag, outside the body. Another method that is  \noften used to relieve ureteric obstruction is an insertion of a JJ stent.  \n \nThe function of a percutaneous nephrostomy is to bypass the ureteric obstruction and  \ntherefore relieve the pa in associated with the obstruction.  \n \nThe percutaneous nephrostomy tube can restore efficient peristalsis to the ureteric  wall \nand in some cases this allows the stone to pass down and out of the ureter with  the \nnephrostomy in situ, however in many instances , it simply sits where it is and  \nsubsequent definitive management to remove the stone is still required."

			"c": "Refer to nephrology",

			"answer": "Serum albumin levels",
			"explanation": "The patient\u2019s urinalysis shows significant proteinuria and to confirm the diagnosis of \nnephrotic syndrome, the next best step would be to check the serum albumin level \n(which will be low in this  case).  The patient\u2019s weight gain and his limb swelling is due to \noedema.  The definition of nephrotic syndrome includes both massive proteinuria and \nhypoalbuminaemia.  \n \nThe cause of this patient\u2019s proteinuria is most likely to be minimal change disease.  The \nincidence is higher in children between 2 to 5 years of age.  In children, facial swelling is \na common presenting feature.  However, the oedema may progress to involve the \nwhole body.  Minimal change glomerulonephritis nearly always presents as nephrot ic \nsyndrome, accounting for the majority of cases in children and about a quarter of cases \nin adults.  Most cases are idiopathic and respond well to steroids.  \n \nThere is no need to repeat the urine analysis as it already confirms proteinuria.  The \nnext best  step would be to check for hypoalbuminaemia.  Once the diagnosis is \nconfirmed, the child can be referred to the nephrology department for further \ninvestigations and treatment."

			"explanation": "Option D.   Creatine Kinase is the correct answer as this patient likely has \nrhabdomyolysis.  Creatine kinase is the investigation used to help diagnose this and \nrhabdomyolysis can result in severe acute kidney injury with life threatening \nhyperkalaemia if left untr eated as well as peramanent kidney damage.  Given that the \npatient had been seen two days ago he may have been laying on the floor for up to two \ndays which is a very high risk of rhabdomyolysis. Furthermore, as a drug user, he may \nhave used stimulant drugs  that would also result in rhabdomyolysis.  \n \nRhabdomyolyisis can be the result of muscle ischaemia due to tissue compression in \ncases of prolonged immobilization, such as comatose situations after an overdose of \ndrugs.  \n Option A.  A full blood count is inco rrect.  Although this may be useful to us in some \nway, in this case it is not the single best answer as it does not direct our steps in \nmanagement greatly or help us find a cause for this presentation or address the main \nconcern in this patient which is th e acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis.  \n \nOption B.  Blood cultures is incorrect.  This is for the same reason as option A.  \n \nOption C.  Abdominal ultrasound scan is incorrect.  Although this imaging is non -\ninvasive and would potentially give us a picture of the kidneys, it is not entirely \nnecessary as the next step in investigating this patient.  It would not help us to diagnose \nrhabdomyolysis at all.  It would be helpful later on to check for any gross structural \ndamage to the kidney.  \n \nOption E.  Amylase is incorrect as in this case it would not help further the management \nor diagnosis in this case.  Amylase is usually used as a blood test when we are \nsuspicious of pancreatitis.

See below for the description \nofthe types of urinary incontinence:  \n Urge incontinence / overactive bladder (OAB) \u2192 is due to detrusor over \nactivity.Common complain t is \u201cwhen I have to go to the toilet, I really have to go\u201d or \u201cI \nhave thedesire to pass urine and sometimes urine leaks before I have time to get to the \ntoilet\u201d  \n \nStress incontinence \u2192 leaking small amounts of urine when coughing or  \nlaughing.Usually with a history of many vaginal deliveries as this would weaken the \npelvic floormuscles.  \n \nMixed incontinence \u2192 a mix of both urge and stress incontinence  \n \nOverflow incontinence \u2192 involuntary release of urine from an overfull urinarybladder , \noften in the absence of any urge to urinate. Occurs in people who have ablockage of the \nbladder outlet (benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, ornarrowing of the \nurethra), or when the muscle that expels urine from the bladder istoo weak to empty the \nbladder normally.  \n \nUrethrovaginal fistula \u2192 Opening between vagina and urethra. Common complaint is\u201c \nthere is continual leakage of urine from my vagina\u201d or \u201cmy vagina has a foul smell\u201d.  \n \nMANAGEMENT OF URINARY INCONTINENCE  \nThe management of incontinence  depends on whether urge or stress urinary \nincontinence is predominant.  \n \nFor stress incontinence:  \n1. Pelvic floor exercise is the initial treatment of choice.  NICE recommends that at \nleast eight contractions are performed three times a day for a minimum of three \nmonths.  \n2. Surgical procedures e.g., retropubic mid -urethral tape procedures may be required.  \n3. Duloxetine is used for those who are not surgical candidates.  \n \nFor urge incontinence  \n1. Bladder retraining (minimum of six weeks).  The idea is to gradually increase the \nintervals between voiding  \n2. Bladder stabilising drugs: antimuscarinic agents are first -line.  NICE recommends \noxybutynin, tolterodine or darifenacin.  Immediate release oxybutynin should, \nhowever, be avoided in frail older women."

			"explanation": "The key to answer this is knowing  when a diagnostic laparoscopy is required for \nendometriosis.  In practice, we would offer a trial of hormonal treatment for a period of 3 \nto 6 months before having a diagnostic laparoscopy.  This is due to the risk of \nlaparoscopic surgery with the additio nal fact that even with a laparoscopic ablation of \nendometrial tissue the relapse of symptoms occurs in 40 to 45% of women with up to \n30% of women being readmitted for surgery within 5 years.  \n \nENDOMETRIOSIS  \nEndometriosis is the presence of endometrial -like tissue outside the uterine cavity. It \nisoestrogen dependent, and therefore mostly affects women during their \nreproductiveyears.

Women ofher \nage group (<25 years old) are of greater risk for pelvic inflammatory disease as theyare \nmore sexually active during this perio d. \n \nOther options are less likely because:  \n \nEndometriosis \u2192 Although  chronic pelvic pain, deep dyspareunia and \nmenstrualirregularities could be seen in endometriosis. It is unlikely the given choice \nhere as thehistory of multiple sexual partners and cervical excitation do not match with \nthisanswer .  This pain is non cyclic al which also suggests PID rather than \nendometriosis.  \n \nFitz-Hugh -Curtis syndrome \u2192 is a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease \n(PID).Usually presents with an acute onset of right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal \npainaggravated by breathing, or coughing.  This pain may be referred to the right \nshoulder  \n \nCervicitis \u2192 Presents with discharge. Do not get confused between cervicitis and \nPID.Infection at the cervix can eventually ascend to cause PID. But if the infection is \npurelyat the cervix, they will not pr esent with menstrual irregularities and lower \nabdominalpain as the infection has not ascended to involve the uterus, fallopian tubes, \nandovaries.  \n \nAsherman syndrome \u2192 are adhesions of the endometrium often associated \nwithdilation and curettage of the intra uterine cavity. It results in infertility. Often, theyexperience menstrual irregularities. But in this question there is no relevant \npastmedical history meaning she did not have any dilation and curettage thus this \noption isvery unlikely.  \n \nPELVIC INFLAMMAT ORY DISEASE (PID)  \nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a term used to describe infection and \ninflammationof the female pelvic organs including the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries \nand thesurrounding peritoneum.

It is unlikely that thePLAB test \nwould ask you the management of PID. PLAB que stions may ask youfor the \nmanagement of cervicitis (but unlikely PID). Remember, cervicitis is notthe same as \nPID. \n \nThis is one of the combination examples for treatment of PID:  \nOutpatients: Ceftriaxone 500 mg as a single intramuscular dose, followed by \noraldoxycycline 100 mg twice daily plus oral metronidazole 400 mg twice daily, both for \n14days.  \n \nNote the differences between acute PID and just cervicitis.  \nIf just cervicitis (Chlamydia)  \n\u2022 Azithromycin 1g single dose (OR doxycycline 100mg bd for 7 days) (bo th havesimilar  \nefficacy of more than 95%)  \n \nIf just cervicitis (Neisseria gonorrhoeae)  \u2022 Azithromycin 1g PO and ceftriaxone 500mg IM  \n \nRCOG guidelines suggest that in mild cases of PID intrauterine contraceptivedevices \nmay be left in.

			"explanation": "Not all questions are straightforward in exams.  You will come across some where you \nwould feel information is missing like this one.  The options of incorrect dates and molar \npregnancy come close.  \n \nIt is important to that that the question states the uterus extends up to 16 weeks \ngestation.  It can therefore be inferred that the  pregnancy is either large for dates with a \nuterine fibroid or molar pregnancy alernatively an incorrect menstrual period date is also \na possibility.  \n \nIf this patient had uterine fibroids, it would NOT explain the excessive morning sickness.  \n \nIf this patie nt had an incorrect menstrual period date and was actually 16 weeks \ngestation, it would NOT explain the reason hyperemesis started so late in pregnancy.  \nSymptoms of hyperemesis would have occurred several weeks ago as hyperemesis \nsymptoms begin 6 to 8 wee ks and peaks at 12 weeks.  \n \nThe patient is presenting with features of molar pregnancy which are uterus large for \ndates, first trimester bleeding, and hyperemesis.  This is a presentation that is also \nsimilar to multiple pregnancies like twin pregnancy as t hey are also at increased risk of \nbleeding, hyperemesis and have a uterus that is larger for dates.  However, in multiple \npregnancies the urterus is seen to be larger in the second trimester rather than the first.  \nAlso, multiple pregnancies is not an opti on given here.   \nHyperemesis gravidarum is not completely incorrect as this patient also has a diagnosis \nof hyperemesis gravidarum as she is seen to be vomiting for the past two weeks.  \nHowever, the most likely diagnosis given the whole clinical picture is still molar \npregnancy.  \n \nGestational Trophoblastic Disease  \nGestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) covers a spectrum of diseases caused \nbyovergrowth of the placenta. It ranges from molar pregnancies to malignant \nconditionssuch as choriocarcinoma. If there is any evidence of persistence of GTD the \ncondition isreferred to as gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).  \n \nGTD is classified as follows:  \nPremalignant - hydatidiform mole  \n\u2022 Complete hydatidiform mole (CHM)  \n\u2022 Partial hydatidif orm mole (PHM)  \n \nMalignant - gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN)  \n\u2022 Invasive mole  \n\u2022 Choriocarcinoma  \n\u2022 Placental site trophoblastic tumour (PSTT)  \n\u2022 Epithelioid trophoblastic tumour (ETT)  \n \nThe classification of GTD is less in important. An exam of this level usually does not  \nrequire you to know details of types of GTD.  \n \nFeatures:  \n\u2022 Hyperemesis  \no Due to excessive amounts of human chorionic gonatotropin (hCG)  \n\u2022 Irregular first -trimester vaginal bleeding  \n\u2022 Uterus large for dates  \n\u2022 Vaginal passage of vesicles containing products of conception  \n\u2022 Serum hCG is excessively high with complete moles, but levels may be withinthe  \nnormal range for partial moles.  \n \nUltrasound findings of a complete mole  \n\u2022 \u2018Snowstorm\u2019 appearance of mixed echogenicity, representin g hydropic villi and  \nintrauterine haemorrhage  \n\u2022 Large theca lutein cysts  \n \nManagement of Hydatidiform mole:  \n\u2022 Surgical evacuation (Suction curettage)  \no Note that histological examination of products of conception isessential to confirm \ndiagnosis  \n\u2022 Two -weekly serum and urine samples until hCG concentrations are normal.  \no Women should be advised not to conceive until hCG level has beennormal for 6 \nmonths  \no Barrier contraception should be used until serum hCG is normal (oral \ncontraception may also be used after molar  evactuation, before hCG returns to \nnormal)  \n Management of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN)  \nThis is unlikely to be asked in detail in PLAB 1 due to the complexity of \nthemanagement.

Ectopic pregnancies would usually present around 6 -8 weeks from start of \nlastperiod as it is then that they are large enough to stretch the fallopian tubes \nthuscausing pain. The stretching of the fallopian t ubes is also the reason why they \nmaysometimes experience cervical motion tenderness on a vaginal examination.  \n \nThe second clue here is the unilateral abdominal pain. This gives us a clue that \nthepathology is towards one side rather than in the middle.  \n \nThe remaining choices are far less likely to be the correct answer  \nFibroids \u2192 In the past, fibroids could be the cause of an inconclusive scan as they \nmayobstruct the view of the gestational sac. However, with the modern transvaginal \nscanthis is n o longer the case. And thus ectopic pregnancies are a more likely \ndiagnosishere.  \n \nComplete miscarriage - Is when all products of conception has been expelled. This \nisunlikely the case as she has only suffered a mild vaginal bleeding (vaginal spotting).  \n \nThreatened miscarriage \u2192 Presents with vaginal bleeding + fetal heart is seen. \nAdiagnosis of threatened miscarriage cannot be made without seeing a viable fetus \nonan ultrasound scan.  \n \nIncomplete miscarriage \u2192 Not all products of conception have been expelled . \nThismeans that products of conception would still be visible on an ultrasound scan.   \nECTOPIC PREGNANCY  \nDefined by the implantation of a fertilized ovum outside the uterus  \n \nClinical features  \n\u2022 lower abdominal pain: typically the first symptom.  \n\u2022 vaginal b leeding: usually less than a normal period  \n\u2022 history of recent amenorrhoea: typically 6 -8 weeks from start of last period  \n\u2022 peritoneal bleeding can cause shoulder tip pain  \n \nAny woman at a childbearing age who attends A&E with abdominal pain MUST have a \nurine pregnancy test performed.

She states that there have been no problems during her pregnancy \nand that she has been seeing her midwife in the community.  On examination, a \nsoft and relaxed uterus is noteed with a fundal height of 32 cm.

			"b": "Placenta accreta",
			"c": "Placenta praevia",
			"d": "Preterm labor",
			"e": "Vasa praevia",
			"answer": "Placenta praevia",
			"explanation": "Painless vaginal bleeding without abdominal pain should raise suspicion of placenta \npraevia.   \n \nIn the UK, it is common to have an ultrasound scan during the first trimester and again \naround 20 weeks for an anomaly scan which the sonongrapher would formall y report \nthe position of the placenta.  In this stem, she did not have previous scans and so she \nmay very well have a low lying placenta.  \n \nThe painless bleeding seen in placenta praevia may occur without warning or after \nintercourse.  This is one reason ob stetricians advise women with placenta praevia not to \nhave intercourse.  \n \nFrom her observations, one can see that it is maternal blood that is being lost which is \nconsistent with placenta praevia.  If this was the case of vasa praevia, it would be foetal \nblood that would be lost and maternal observations would remain normal.  \n \nPlacental abruption presents with sudden onset abdominal pain +/ - vaginal bleeding.  It \nis also commonly associated with CTG abnormalities.  \n \nPlacenta accreta is less common than placent a praevia and are seen commonly in the \npresence of a uterine scar which alows the placenta to attach to the myometrium  \n PLACENTA PRAEVIA  \nPlacenta praevia describes a placenta lying wholly or partly in the lower \nuterinesegment.This is common early in the pregnancy, but is most often not associated \nwith bleeding.  \n \nThe key clinical feature is painless bleeding after 24 weeks of gestation.  \n \nRisk factors  \n\u2022 previous placenta praevia  \n\u2022 multiple pregnancies  \n \nClinical features  \n\u2022 Painless vaginal bleed  \n\u2022 uterus not tender  \n\u2022 lie and presentation may be abnormal  \n\u2022 fetal heart usually normal  \n \nThe painless late -pregnancy bleeding may occur during rest or activity, suddenlyand \nwithout warning. It may be preceded by trauma, coitus, or pelvic examination.   A digi tal \nvaginal examination should not be performed.  However, a speculum or a transvaginal \nprobe can safely be used in placenta praevia.  \n \nDiagnosis  \nThis is based on the presence of painless late -trimester vaginal bleeding with \nanobstetric ultrasound showing p lacental implantation over the lower uterine segment.  \n \nA transvaginal ultrasound is preferred over abdominal ultrasound for detection \nofplacenta praevia.  \n \nIn the UK, most low -lying placentas are detected at the routine anomaly scans (around \n20 weeks gestat ion).  This is done transabdominally.  If the placenta extends over the \ninternal cervical os, they are offered another transabdominal scan at 32 weeks.  If the \nposition of the placenta is still unclear using a transabdominal scan, a transvaginal scan \nis offered.  \n \nAround 5% will have low -lying placenta when scanned at 16 -20 weeks gestation \nhowever the incidence at delivery is only 0.5%, therefore most placentas rise away from \ncervix during the second and third trimester."

She had been experiencing mild abdominal pain \nsince the insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) two months \nago.  Her last menstr ual period was seven days ago.  On speculum examination, \nthe IUCD strings were not visualized.  The patient says that she is in a long term \nsexual relationship with her boyfriend of three years.  The patient was \nsubsequently referred fro a transvaginal ult rasound whereupon the IUCD was not \nfound in the uterus.  What is the SINGLE most appropriate next step in this case?",

			"b": "Hysteroscopy",
			"c": "Laparoscopy",
			"d": "Emergency contraception",
			"e": "Reassure that the IUD has fallen out",
			"answer": "X-ray of the abdomen",
			"explanation": "To answer this question accurately, it is essential to know about the management of lost \nintrauterine device threads.  \n \nHow do we manage lost intrauterine device threads?  \n \n1. Exclude pregnancy by performing a urine pregnancy test  \n2. Request a pelvic ultrasound to look for the IUCD  \n3. If the IUCD is not found on ultrasound, request an abdominal X -ray \n \nEmergency contraceptin is incorrect as there is no evidence of recent sexual \nintercourse in the stem.  Remember, one needs to know the timing of se xual intercourse \nto know which emergency contraception to use.  Example, levonorgestrel can be used \nfor up to 72 hours whereas ulipristal acetate and copper intrauterine device can be used \nup to 5 days.  \n \nWe are not sure if the coil is in place.  There is n o evidence of sexual intercourse.  \n \nA hysteroscopy may be used to remove an IUCD from within the uterine cavity provided \nit is proven to be there.  \n \nAn X -ray of the abdomen would be best to determine if the IUCD is in the abdomen.  \nThis can occur when the IU CD perforates through the uterus during insertion or finds a \nway to migrate to the abdominal cavity when initially inserted intrauterine.  If the IUCD is \nfound outside the uterus but inside the abdominal cavity, a laparoscopy can be done to \nretrieve it.  \n \n \n \n \n MANAGEMENT OF LOST INTRAUTERINE DEVICE THREADS  \n \n \n \nThe explanation below is rather specific and most likely not required for PLAB but they \ndo help with the understanding of what do you do in situations where the IUD thread is \nnot found.  \n \nSpeculum examination reveals no IUD thread  \n\u2022 Take menstrual and sexual history, exclude pregnancy.  Provide alternative \ncontraception and/or post coital contraception if indicated by history  \n\u2022 If woman is pregnant  \no Refer to Early Pregnancy Unit for rapid access  to ultrasound scan.  Viabilty of \npregnancy, site, gestation will need to be determined.  The management from \nhere on is rather complex and unlikely to be asked in the PLAB test  \n\u2022 If woman is not pregnant  \no Refer for ultrasound scan.  Ensure contraception is g iven until ultrasound scan \nis performed.  \n\u25aa If ultrasound scan reports misplaced in cavity, the management depends on \nsymptoms and degree of displacement.  \n\u25aa If ultrasound scan reports device is correctly located in the uterus, leave the \nIUD in situ until it is due to be removed.  \n\u25aa If IUD not seen in uterus, order a plain abdominal X -ray \n\u2022 If abdo X -ray shows IUD is in the abdominal cavity, this may require \nlaparoscopic removal  \n\u2022 If abdo X -ray shwos IUD not located, this implies that IUD has fallen out \nand replacement of IUD can be offered."

			"explanation": "She has been diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome in the past.  This puts her at \nrisk for blood clots and she would eventually need heparin.  Heparin and aspirin also \nreduces the risk of miscarriages in patients with diagnosed antiphospholipid syndrome.  \n \nNICE guidelines (2015) gives clear recommendations for use of prophylactic cerclage \nand prophylactic vaginal progesterone.  They should be offered to women if she has a \nhistory of spontaneous preterm birth or mid -trimester loss between 16 weeks and 34 \nweeks of gestation AND in whom a transvaginal ultrasound scan has been carried out \nbetween 16 to 24 weeks of pregnancy that reveals a cervical length of less than 25 mm.  \nProphylactic cervical cerclage can also be considered in women with cervical length \nless than 25 mm who have a history of cervical trauma like a LLETZ procedure.  T his \npatient had 3 early miscarriages and thus there is no indication for a cervical cerclage or \nprogesterone pessaries.  \n \nCERVICAL CERCLAGE  \nCervical weakness is a recognised cause of second -trimester miscarriage. The \ndiagnosisis essentially a clinical one  and based on a history of second -\ntrimestermiscarriage preceded by spontaneous rupture of membranes or \npainlesscervical dilatation.  \n \nCervical cerclage does come with risks which are related to the surgery.  Risks include \ninfections and rupture of the membran es. \n \nThe criteria is a strict and complicated one thus it is unlikely  to bea correct answer \nduring PLAB part 1. Nonetheless, if they do give a history of painlessdilatation during \nthe previous miscarriages, cervical cerclage could be the option.  \n ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME  \nAntiphospholipid syndrome is the most important treatable cause of \nrecurrentmiscarriage. Antiphospholipid syndrome refers to the association \nbetweenantiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies and \nanti-B2 glycoprotein -I antibodies) and adverse pregnancy outcome or vascular \nthrombosis.  \n \nAll women with recurrent first -trimester miscarriage and all women with one or \nmoresecond -trimester miscarriage should be screened before pregnancy \nforantiphospholipid  antibodies.   Note the term recurrent miscarriage refers to loss of \nthree or more consecutive pregnancies.  \n \nIf diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome, p regnant women can be treated with \naspirin 75 mg plus heparin as this is seen to lower the risk of furt her miscarriage.  \n \nCorticosteroids have no role in improving live birth rate of women with recurrent \nmiscarriage associated with antiphospholipid antibodies."

It is unlikely that it has perforated the uterus as \nifso, the patient would be presenting with an acute abdomen. Transvaginal \nultraso undhas better image quality when looking at the uterus compared to a \ntransabdominalultrasound. An X -ray is capable of seeing the intrauterine device as well \nbut it isreserved for more acute presentations like suspected perforation or when the \nIUD isnot see n on a ultrasound scan.  \n \nCombined oral contraceptives are not completely wrong as if there was a delay \ninobtaining the ultrasound scan, it may be necessary to start the woman on a form \nofcontraception until the ultrasound scan can be performed.

It is likely that she was prescribed a broad spect rum \nantibiotic which has destroyed the normal flora leading to development of vaginal \nthrush.  \n \nIt is well known that broad -spectrum antibiotics destroy healthy bacteria and disrupt the \nvagina\u2019s normal flora which can predispose women to develop either vagi nal candidiasis \ndue to the change of the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina.  \n \nWhy pick candidiasis and not gardnerella?  \n \nWhile both may be good answers, candidiasis is more likely a better answer as broad -\nspectrum antibiotics that inhibit lactobacilli also inhibit Gardnerella which makes it less \nlikely to trigger bacterial vaginosis."

			"b": "Endometrial cancer",
			"c": "Ovarian cancer",
			"d": "Sexually transmitted infection",
			"e": "Vaginal cancer",
			"answer": "Endometrial cancer",
			"explanation": "The idea here is to think of endometrial cancer. Any women who has  postmenopausal \nbleeding should have a transvaginal ultrasound to determine the endometrial thickness. \nIf the endometrium is thick, hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy would be arranged.  \n \nA cervical smear is offered every 5 years in the UK if in the age g roup of 50 to 64 years \nold. Thus, having a cervical smear that was normal 3 years ago is a usual phenomenon.  \nA repeat cervical smear is not necessary.  \n \nENDOMETRIAL CANCER  \nEndometrial cancer is classically seen in post -menopausal women.  \nClassically,endome trial cancer presents as postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) and, \nalthough this is  \nnot the only cause, it must be excluded.   \nRisk factors for endometrial cancer:  \n\u2022 Obesity  \n\u2022 Nulliparity  \n\u2022 Early menarche  \n\u2022 Late menopause  \n\u2022 Unopposed oestrogen. The addition of a progestogen to oestrogen reducesthis risk  \n(e.g. In HRT).

			"explanation": "The diagnosis of premature ovarian failure usually needs two raised levels of FSH(more \nthan 40 IU/L) taken at least four weeks apart. In this question, since she isamenorrheic \nwith raised FSH and LH and a normal prolactin level, the most likelydiagnosis wo uld be premature ovarian failure. Women with premature ovarian failurealso have low estradiol \n(usually < 50 pmol/l).  \n \nPREMATURE OVARIAN FAILURE  \nPremature ovarian failure (Premature ovarian insufficiency) is defined as the onset \nofmenopausal symptoms and el evated gonadotropin levels before the age of 40 years. \nItoccurs in around 1 in 100 women.  \n \nCauses  \n\u2022 Idiopathic - the most common cause  \n\u2022 Chemotherapy (this can be temporary, as recovery of ovarian function canoccur,  \nespecially in younger women)  \n\u2022 Radiatio n \n\u2022 Autoimmune disease  \n\u2022 Bilateral oophorectomy or surgical menopause  \n \nPresentation  \n1.

In this stem an age of 42 was used.  \n \nAlthough trauma may elicit placenta abruption, majority of abruptions do not have a \nbackground history of injury to the abdomen.

			"c": "Anti-D immunoglobulin",
			"d": "Assess fetal middle cerebral artery on ultrasound",
			"e": "Fetal blood sampling",
			"answer": "Assess fetal middle cerebral artery on ultrasound",
			"explanation": "This woman has developed anti -D immunoglobulins (Rhesus isoimmunisation) as a \nresult of recurrent antepartum haemorrhages in a previous pregnancy.  The fetus is at \nrisk of these antibodies crossing the placenta, leading to fetal anaemia and hydrops \nfetalis.  \n \nAssessing the fetal middle cerebral artery on ultrasound allows estimation of fetal \nhaemoglobin concentrations and therefore the seve rity of fetal anaemia.  This is usually \nperformed in a rhesus negative women following rhesus isoimmunized in a previous \npregnancy.  \n \nFetal cord blood sampling is an option to directly quantify fetal haemoglobin \nconcentration, but is only indicated if the p eak systolic velocity (PSV) of the middle \ncerebral artery (MCA) is abnormal.  \n \nA Kleihauer -Betke test is used to confirm and quantify a maternal -fetal haemorrhage in \nthe preventioin of Rhesus isoimmunization.

			"e": "Progestin -Only pill",
			"answer": "Nexplanon\u00ae",
			"explanation": "The key to choosing the correct answer here is to take into account firstly the fact \nthatthis woman has fibroids which are distorting her uterine cavity and the fact that \nanytype of pill is not an option.  \n Depo -provera, even though a viable op tion, isn\u2019t the correct option for this stem.Depo -\nprovera has a dosing interval of 13 -16 weeks which is a pretty long time, but outof all \nthe options is not the longest time.  \n \nAn Intra -Uterine System (Mirena) which is the favorite of British examiners is n ot \nthechoice here because insertion of an intra -uterine device would be difficult due to \nthefibroid uterus that is distorting the uterine cavity. The use of an Intra -Uterine \nSystem(Mirena) is contraindicated in women with congenital or acquired uterine \nanomaly,including fibroids if they distort the uterine cavity.  \n \nIn actual fact and in clinical practice, having a large fibroid that distorts the uterine cavity \nis NOT a contraindication for insertion of a mirena coil. Gynaecologist still use mirena \ncoils for  patients with large fibroids that distort the cavity. While it is true that the risk of \nexpulsion of a mirena coil is greater if the fibroid is large, there is no reason why it \ncannot first be tried. However, for the purpose of the exam, since the prescri bing leaflet \ndoes mention that it is contraindicated if fibroids distort the uterine cavity, please do not \nchoose the mirena coil as the answer.  \n \nNexplanon\u00ae is the only contraceptive implant on the UK market. Nexplanon\u00ae is a 4 \ncmflexible rod containing 68 mg etonogestrel (a progestogen) which is released \nslowlyinto the systemic circulation following subdermal insertion in the upper arm.

			"question": "A 28 year old primiparous woman, with no previous history of infection with \nherpes zoster, is 18 weeks pregnant.  She had significant contact with a young \ngirl with widespread chicken pox 8 days ago.  Serum stored from an antenatal \nbooking blood sample was sent for serology and came back negative for VZV \nIgG.  She has no rash at present.  What is the SINGLE most appropriate \nmanagement?",
			"a": "Oral aciclovir",
			"b": "Intravenous aciclovir and varicella -zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG)",
			"c": "Intravenous aciclovir",
			"d": "Reassure",
			"e": "Intravenous  varicella -zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG)",
			"answer": "Intravenous varicella -zoster immunoglobin (VZIG)",
			"explanation": "The incubation period between exposure and the first skin lesions is around 10 to 14 \ndays but can be as long as 21 days.  She was only exposed 8  days ago.  The best \nmanagement here is to administer varicella -zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) as it is \neffective when administered up to 10 days after contact.  \n \nChickenpox exposure in pregnancy  \nChickenpox is caused by primary infection with varicella zoster  virus. Shingles \nisreactivation of dormant virus in dorsal root ganglion. In pregnancy there is a risk \ntoboth the mother and also the fetus, a syndrome now termed fetal varicella syndrome  \n \nFetal varicella syndrome (FVS)  \n\u2022 risk of FVS following maternal varicella exposure is around 1% if occurs before 20 \nweeks gestation studies have shown a very small number of cases occurring \nbetween 20 -28 weeks gestation and none following 28 weeks  \n\u2022 features of FVS include skin scarring, eye defects (microphthal mia), limb \nhypoplasia, microcephaly and learning disabilities  \n \nOther risks to the fetus  \nshingles in infancy: 1 -2% risk if maternal exposure in the second or thirdtrimester \nsevere neonatal varicella: if mother develops rash between 5 daysbefore and 2 days \nafter birth there is a risk of neonatal varicella, which may befatal to the newborn child in \naround 20% of cases  \n \nManagement of chickenpox exposure  \nPLAB usually would test your knowledge on 3 of these scenarios:  \n1. Who gets checked for Varicella antibodies?  \nIf the woman\u2019s immunity to chickenpox is unknown and if there is any doubtabout \nprevious infection, or if there is no previous history of chickenpox orshingles, serum \nshould be tested for VZV IgG. This can usually be performedwithin 24 \u201348 hours  and \noften within a few hours if the laboratory can accessserum stored from an antenatal \nbooking blood sample. At least 80% of womentested will have VZV IgG and can be \nreassured.  \n \n2. Who gets VZIG?  \nIf the pregnant woman is not immune to VZV and she has had a significantexposure, \nshe should be offered VZIG as soon as possible. VZIG is effectivewhen given up to 10 \ndays after contact.  \n \nNote: If the immune status of the woman is unknown, the administration ofVZIG can be \ndelayed until serology results are ava ilable  \n \nNote: VZIG has no therapeutic benefit once chickenpox has developed andshould \ntherefore not be used in pregnant women who have developed achickenpox rash.  \n \n3. Who gets oral aciclovir?  \nOral aciclovir should be prescribed for pregnant women with chic kenpox ifthey present \nwithin 24 hours of the onset of the rash and if they are 20+0weeks of gestation or \nbeyond.  \n \n \n In summary:  \n1. Pregnant exposed to chicken pox \u2192 Check women\u2019s immunity (previous  infection,  \n    varicella antibodies)  \n2. Not immuned \u2192 Administer VZIG  \n3. If develop chicken pox rash \u2192 Administer oral aciclovir"

Basically, extremes \nofboth ages. Headaches, epigastric pain, flashing lights are all symptoms of \npreecl ampsiawhich is confirmed by having protein in the urine with a BP > 140/90.  \n \nThe first thing to do here is to lower the blood pressure.

The fact that there are no signs of  \nperitonism, no shoulder tip pain or per vaginal bleeding and observations are normal  \nmeans that a ruptured ectopic is unlikely.  \n As she is haemodynamically stable with sev ere right abdominal pain, a laparoscopic  \napproach to the surgical management of tubal pregnancy is warranted however we  \nwould need to obtain a serum beta -hCG test first. With the results of the serum \nbetahCG,  we would be able to plan the next step in manag ement. If the serum beta -\nhCG was less than 1500 IU/litre and patient is clinically stable with pain resolving, then \nwe would prefer expectant management where we would just observe. The reason \nbehind  this, is that one cannot be sure of the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy when \nthe serum beta -hCG is less then 1500 IU/litre as it could very well be an intrauterine  \npregnancy that is just too small to see on a scan at the moment. If a beta -hCG was  \nmore than 1500 IU/litre, we would expect to see a gestational s ac in the uterus.   \nMeaning if the beta -hCG was more than 1500 IU/litre and nothing can be found in the  \nuterus on a transvaginal ultrasound, the diagnosis of an ectopic can be certain.    \n \nLaparotomy would be the choice if the patient is clearly haemodynamic ally unstable.   \nThe reason for this is laparotomy is quicker than a laparoscopy.  \n \nCuldocentesis was previously used to diagnose a ruptured ectopic pregnancy by the  \npresence of free fluid in the pouch of Douglas. However, ultrasonography is  noninvasive \nand has largely replaced culdocentesis where available."

The only option to preserve fertility here is a  \nmyomectomy.  \nEndometrial ablation is a very good option to decrease menorrhagia however the  \nprocedure involves using electrical currents or heated water to destroy the  endometrium \nwhich could result in infertility. This procedure is therefore NOT  recommended for \nwomen who still want children. It is also important to note that  endometrial ablation is \nnot used in patients with large fibroids. It  is primarily used in  patients with heavy \nmenstrual bleedings due to endometrial hyperplasia without  fibroids, but it can also be \nused to treat small submucosal fibroids.  \n Uterine artery embolisation (UAE) is an alternative procedure to a hysterectomy or  \nmyomectomy for treating fibroids.

It is recommended for women  with large \nfibroids however it is not recommended if the woman is trying to conceive  as it redu ces \nblood to the uterus significantly.  \n \nThe levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG -IUS) is a small, plastic, t -shaped device  \nplaced in your uterus that slowly releases progestogen. It also acts as a contraceptive  \nand thus should not be used for a woman tr ying to conceive.  \n \nGnRH analogues essentially shrink the fibroids however they would grow back once the  \nmedication is stopped.

			"explanation": "Before you go any further, remember that progesterone should be taken 7 days prior to \nher menstrual bleed.  This woman has a 35 day menstrual cycle.  In order for her \nhormone levels to be accurately interpreted, we would need to take a blood sample \nfrom her on day 28 of her menstrual cycle.  This is equivalent to day 21 of a standard 28 \nday menstrual cycle.  To get the best day to meas ure progesterone levels you take \n(total length of the cycle) \u2013 7 days.  Example, in this patient it would be 35 (her total \ncycle length) \u2013 7 days = 28.  The progesterone levels are low because it is not taken on \nthe appropriate day.  \n \nPremature ovarian fail ure would have persistently elevated FSH and LH levels  \n \nPolycystic ovary syndrome would usually have elevated levels of LH."

As this is not an option \ngiven, the next best option would be to arrange a transvaginal ultrasound scan.  \n \nTransvaginal ultrasounds are useful as an intiial investigation for irregular heavy vaginal \nbleeding even in the perimenopausal period with its primary use to look at endometrial \nthickness as a thick endometrium would prompt a referral for a hysteroscopy and  \nendometrial biopsy to exclude endometrial cancer.  \n \nThe reason we say that she is perimenopausal and not menopausal is because \nperimenopause includes the period beginningwith the first clinical, biological, and \nendocrinological features of the approaching menopause, such as vasomotor symptoms \nand menstrual irregularity whereas menopause is defined as 1 year of amenorrhoea \nafter the age of 50 years old (alternatively 2 years of amenorrhoea after the age of 45).  \n \nFibroids may also be a cause of irregular heav y bleeding, but at this age group, it has \nless of an impact as fibroids tend to decrease in size once reaching perimenopause and \nmenopause.  This is because of the decrease in oestrogen and progesterone which are \nhormones involved in stimulating growth of the fibroids.  \n \nThe confusion that people have with this question is that they are looking for a test that \nis used to diagnose menopause.  A key point worth remembering from NICE guidelines in 2015 is that the diagnosis of menopause in healthy women above t he age of 45 years \nshould be based on sym -ptoms and menopausal pattern and thus we should NOT \nroutinely check FSH. FSH levels tend to fluctuate in the perimenopausal period and so \nare unhelpful in diagnosing menopause in women above the age of 45.  \n \nWhen isFSH useful?  \nIt is useful in the diagnosis of premature ovarian failure or early menopause (< 45 y).  \nTwo FSH levels would be required and they are taken 4 to 8 weeks apart.  FSH also \nhas its use in decisions regarding stopping contraception however it is  unlikely to be \nraised.  \n \nSerum estradiol and progesterone is not helpful and it is not recommended by NICE in \ndiagnosing menopause.  \n \nKey point to remember in this question:  \nA transvaginal ultrasound scan may be considered for woemn with atypical symptoms \nof menopause which would involve heavy irregular bleeding."

An ultrasound cannot exclude placental  abruption, which is a \nclinical diagnosis.  \n \nPlacenta praevia usually presents with a painless vaginal bleed however the abdominal \npain in this stem could very well be mild contraction pains.  \n \nWith every episode of bleeding, a rhesus -negati ve woman should have a Kleihauer test  \nand be given prophylactic anti -D immunoglobulin however this is should not be done in  \nan acute setting as the first investigation.

It can improve dysmenorrhoea,  \nlighten periods, regulate the cycle, improve premenstrual symptoms, COCP is very  \nuseful in adolescence. Also note that tranexamic acid is also effective.  \n \nAlthough levonorgestrel intra -uterine system is first line for menorrhagia, it is diff icult to \nfit in a nulliparous woman as her cervix has not yet been dilated before. However,  there \nhas been more and more research regarding the use of levonorgestrel intrauterine  \nsystems in nulliparous woman and some clinicians would prefer levonorgestrel  intra-\nuterine system to combined oral contraceptives. Their argument is that the  \nlevonorgestrel intra -uterine systems such as Jaydess\u00ae may be fitted more easily, as the  \nframe is smaller and narrower compared to the Mirena\u00ae IUS.   In this situation, she is \nnot sexually active so preference should go towards combined oral contraception to \ncontrol the bleeding as a girl her age might feel uncomfortable with a speculum \nexamination.  \n \nNSAIDS such as mefenamic acid may decrease menstrual blood loss by up to 20 \u201330% \nand also significant decreases in dysmenorrhoea. But it will not regulate her periods  \nwhereas COCP will regulate an irregular cycle.  \n \nNICE have suggested that these medical management of heavy menstrual bleeding \nshould be considered in the following order:  \n1.

			"c": "Cone biopsy",
			"d": "Large loop excision  of the transformation zone (LLETZ) procedure",
			"e": "Endocervical swab",

			"explanation": "The first step is understanding  that the screening result of mild dyskaryosis would follow \nsamples being sent for HPV testing.  If mild dyskaryosis is present but there is an \nabsence of HPV testing, then this case should be referred to colposcopy.  This means \nthat if HPV testing was par t of the options, that would be a better answer compared to \ncolposcopy.  \n \nThe second step is understanding what a colposcopy includes. A colposcopy involves  \nvisualising the cervix using a microscope. A speculum is used to open the vagina and  \nthe cervix is s tained with acetic acid in the area of the transformation zone (TZ) to  \nidentify the site, grade and shape of any abnormal area of cells. Iodine is then gently  \napplied to the rest of the cervix to identify the complete area of abnormality. A small  \nbiopsy is  usually taken to be sent to the laboratory. When an area of abnormality  \nextends into the cervical canal beyond the area that can be seen with the colposcope,  a \ncone biopsy is indicated. We need a colposcopy first before we can be certain if a  cone \nbiopsy is required, hence the option for cone biopsy is incorrect.  \n \nLarge loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) takes place at the end of  \ncolposcopy if abnormality is obvious on colposcopy or for women who have had a  \npositive biopsy result.

As this has already been  \ngiven and dehydration managed, intravenous antiemetics is  the next best answer since  \nonly intramuscular cyclizine has been given. Regular antiemetics such as promethazine  \nor cyclizine are often tried first in many early pregnancy units. If this fails,  \nprochlorperazine intramuscularly or orally can be added on.

			"explanation": "Women who need treatment for vasomotor symptoms postmenopausally should be \ngiven hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for up to 5 years  after discussing the long -\nterm benefits and risks.  The rationale behind prescribing combined hormone \nreplacement therapy for a woman who still has a uterus is to prevent endometrial \nhyperplasia which could lead to endometrial cancer if only an oestrogen preparation is \nused.  As she has had a hysterectomy, an oestrogen -only hormone replacement \ntherapy would be suitable as she is no longer at risk of endometrial cancer.  \n \nSmoking is not a contraindication for HRT use.  A transdermal approach would be \npreferr ed here as smoking can reduce the efficancy of orally administered oestrogens.  \nTransdermal HRT does not inctrease the risk of venous thromboembolism whereas an \noral HRT is seen to increase venous thromboembolism by 2 to 3 folds.  Since she is a \nsmoker, it  would be wise to prescribe a transdermal HRT instead of oral to reduce her \nrisk of venous thromboembolism.  A point to remember in case the question asks \nspecifically for the preferred route of HRT administration.  \n \nClonidine used to be popular for the tre atment of vasomotor symptoms however it \nshould not be used as first -line treatment of vasomotor symptoms as there is limited \nevidence of its efficacy and has many side effects.  \n \nTo recap, there are three types of HRT used.  \n \nOestrogen -only HRT  \n\u2022 Used on women who have a hysterectomy or an intrauterine system in situ  \n \nSequential (cyclica) combined HRT  \n\u2022 Used in peri -menopausal women who are still menstruating or are within 12 months \nof their last period  \n\u2022 Sequential combined HRT is where oestrogen is taken every day, and progestogen \nis taken sequentially (usually for the last 14 days of menstrual cycle) to induce a \nbleed.  \n\u2022 Patients are often switched to continuous combined hormone replacement therapy \nafter 12 months   \nContinuous combined HRT  \n\u2022 Used in meno pausal women (i.e. women who have had their last period more than \n12 months ago)  \n\u2022 As the name suggests, continuous combined HRT is where oestrogen and \nprogestogen dose are taken daily  \n \n  \nOPHTHALMOLOG Y \nQuestions&Answers"

			"explanation": "There has been a long debate regarding the use of topical antibiotics in bacterial \nconjunctivitis.  NHS has been moving towards using self care rather than antibiotics for \ninfective conjunctivitis.  For most people, use of a topical ocular antibiotic makes  little \ndifference to recovery from infective conjunctivitis and up to 10% of people treated with \ntopical ocular antibiotic makes little difference to recovery from infective conjunctivitis \nand up to 10% of people treated with topical ocular antibiotics co mplain of adverse \nreactions to treatment.  Not to mention, that the risk of a serious complication from \nuntreated infective conjunctivitis is low.  \n \nThus, one should only consider topical ocular antibiotics if the infective conjunctivitis is \nsevere, or like ly to become severe, providing serious causes of a red eye can \nconfidently excluded.  It would seem reasonable to consider infective conjunctivitis to be \nsevere when the person considers the symptoms to be distressing or signs are judged \nto be severe from clinical experience.  However, it is obvious that you will not be able to \ntell based on the PLAB questions if it is severe conjunctivitis or mild conjunctivitis.  So a \ngood guideline that you should follow is based on time.  If the patient has infective \nconjunctivitis for more than 7 days, then start the patient on topical antibiotics.  If it is \nless than 7 days, then choose the option that has self -care rather than topical \nantibiotics.  \n \nTopical steroids is  always going to be the wrong answer unless it is herpes simplex \nvirus conjunctivitis.  It is only used if keratitis extends deep into the stoma.  \n \nBacterial conjunctivitis management  \n\u2022 Most cases of infective conjunctivitis do not need medical treatment and clear up in \none to two weeks.  \n\u2022 Gently clean away sticky discharge from your eyelids and lashes using cotton wool \nsoaked in water.  \n\u2022 If the decision is made to use antibiotics \u2192 chloramphenicol drops is the drug of \nchoice.

Approximately 10% of  \npatients with ocular involvement in giant cell arteritis experience a central retinal artery  \nocclusion.  \nThe sudden loss of vision in one eye and the pale retina with cherry red spots seen in  \nthe macula are diagnostic for central retinal artery occlusion.  \n \nCentral retinal artery occlusion  \nCentral retinal artery occlusion occurs when the central retinal artery occludes before \nitbranches out as it emerges from the optic nerve, resulting in almost complete \nhypoxiaof the inner retina.  \n \nPresentation  \n- Sudden (over a few seconds)  \n- Unilateral painless visual loss  \n- In 94% of cases, vision is usually reduced to counting fingers (worse suggeststhat the  \nophthalmic artery may also be a ffected  \n- There may be a history of amaurosis fugax (amaurosis fugax precedes loss ofvision in  \nup to 10% of patients)  \n- There is no redness of the eye  \n \nExamination:  \n- An afferent pupil defect appears within seconds and may precede retinalchanges by 1  \nhour.

Headaches and  decreased visual acuity are common. \nSymptomsworsen with mydriasis (e.g. watching TV in a dark room). Coloured haloes \naround lightsmay be seen by patients. Palpation of the globe will reveal it to be hard. \nCornealoedema results in dull or hazy cornea.

The fact \nthat shehas multiple sclerosis is a huge hint. Visual field loss is a known feature of optic \nneuritis.Some may argue that scotoma can also be present in optic neuritis, but in \nreality  \nmonocular visual field loss is more frequently seen.  \n \nTo understand the reason behin d the patient\u2019s pupils dilating when the light stimulus \nisdirected to the affected eye (left eye), one has to understand the principles of \ntheMarcus Gunn test. In the Marcus Gunn test, light stimulation of the normal \neyeproduces full constriction in both p upils. Immediate subsequent stimulus of \ntheaffected eye produces an apparent dilation in both pupils since the stimulus \ncarriedthrough that optic nerve is weaker. The affected eye still senses light and \nproducespupillary sphincter constriction to some degr ee but it\u2019s less compared to the \nnormaleye. This is specifically seen in optic neuropathy such as optic neuritis.  \n \nBoth central scotoma and monocular visual loss can be seen in optic neuritis and in \nactual fact, central scotoma is more common.  The rationa le behind monocular visual \nloss as the more more appropriate answer compared to central scotom is that this \npatient presents with a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD).  This tells us that it is \nlikely the whole optic nerve that has been damaged rath er than a part of it.  Central \nscotomas are dependent on which part of the optic nerve is affected.  If the whole optic \nnerve is affected, this would result in monocular visual loss."

			"answer": "Retinal detachment",
			"explanation": "Causes of sudden painless loss of vision:  \n- Retinal detachment  \n- Vitreous haemorrhage  \n- Retinal vein occlusion  \n- Retinal artery occlusion  \n- Optic neuritis  \n- Cerebrovascular accident  \n \nAmong all the causes of painless loss of vision, retinal detachment fits as they give \nclueslike the tiny black dots which are \u201cfloaters\u201d and the ty pical description of a \u201ccurtain  \nfalling down\u201d.  \n \nIf you cannot see an retinal detachment on ophthalmoscopy but suspect it, refer \nthepatient on for a slit -lamp examination (direct ophthalmoscopy offers only a narrow \nfieldof view).  \n \nRETINAL DETACHMENT  \nRetinal detachment is usually spontaneous, but it may result from trauma.   It occurs \nwhen the force that holds the retinal detachment fails which results in accumulation of \nfluid in the subretinal spaces.  The two most common predisposing factor s are extreme \nmyopia and surgical extractionof cataracts.   It is associated with age and it is rarely \nseen under 40 years old.  \n \nClinical Presentation  \n\u2022 The classic symptom is photopsia (flashing lights).  \n\u2022 A common presentation is blurry vision developing in one eye without pain or \nredness.  \n\u2022 The patient may complain of seeing \"floaters;' as well as flashes at the periphery of \nvision.  \n\u2022 A good descriptive term used by patients is \"it feels like a curtain coming down\" or \n\u201cit feels like a dark shadow across my visi on\u201d \u2013 this occurs as the retina falls off the \nsclera behind it.  \n \nRemember this:  \nDetachment presents with 4 \u2018F\u2019s :  \n\u2022 Floaters  \n\u2022 Flashes  \n\u2022 Field loss  \n\u2022 Fall in acuity  \n \nDiagnosis  \n\u2022 Direct ophthalmoscopy  \no Grey opaque and wrinkled retina that balloons forward.  \n \nTreatment  \n\u2022 Patients should lean their heads back to promote the chance that the retina will fall \nback into place.  \n\u2022 The retina can be mechanically reattached to the sclera surgically, by laser \nphotocoagulation, cryotherapy, or by the injection of expansile g as into the vitreal \ncavity (gas will press the retina back into place)  \u2022 Scleral buckling is another option where a \"buckle,\" or belt, can be placed around \nthe sclera to push the sclera forward so that it can come into contact with the retina."

For most people, use of a topical ocular antibiotic makes \nlittledifference to recovery from infective conjunctivitis and up to 10% of people \ntreatedwith topical ocular antibiotics complain of adverse rea ctions to treatment. Not \ntomention, that the risk of a serious complication from untreated infective conjunctivitisis \nlow. \n \nThus, one should only consider topical ocular antibiotics if the infective conjunctivitis \nissevere, or likely to become severe, prov iding serious causes of a red eye can \nbeconfidently excluded. It would seem reasonable to consider infective conjunctivitis \ntobe severe when the person considers the symptoms to be distressing or signs \narejudged to be severe from clinical experience. Howev er, it is obvious that you will not \nbeable to tell based on the PLAB questions if it is severe conjunctivitis or \nmildconjunctivitis. So a good guideline that you should follow is based on time. If \nthepatient has infective conjunctivitis for more than 7 day s, then start the patient \nontopical antibiotics. If it is less than 7 days, then choose the option that has self -\ncarerather than topical antibiotics.  \n \nTopical steroids is always going to be the wrong answer unless it is herpes simplex \nvirusconjunctivitis. It is only used if keratitis extends deep into the stroma."

Distal pulses and sensation of her hand is intact.  Her hand \nlooks well perfused.  X -ray revealed a fract ure of the distal end of the radius with \na 10 degree dorsal angulation.  What is the SINGLE best management for her?",
			"a": "Closed reduction of the fracturre",
			"b": "Open reduction and internal fixation",
			"c": "Above elbow backslap cast",
			"d": "Closed reduction followed by Plaster of P aris cast below elbow",
			"e": "Wrist sling",
			"answer": "Closed reduction followed by Plaster of Paris cast below elbow",
			"explanation": "To choose the correct answer, we first need to know the diagnosis. This is a Colles'  \nfracture.  \n \nColles' fracture is a fracture of the di stal radius with dorsal displacement of fragments.   It \ntypically occurs from a fall onto an outstretched hand that results in forced  dorsiflexion \nof the wrist. The characteristic dinner fork deformity makes it easy to  recognize, along \nwith the classical history. The management of the type of cast to be  used in a Colles' \nfracture is still heavily debated however, the patient\u2019s age and any  potential disability \nshould be taken into consideration. We should always aim to tailor  management for \nindivi dual patients and their needs rather than apply generalized rules  across the \npopulation.  \n \nThis patient is elderly and she has mild dementia. In this situation, the best type of  \nmanagement for her should be a complete cast below the elbow in order to maxima lly \nimmobilize her wrist and prevent further injury to her wrist, thus causing potential  \ncomplications.  \n \nA backslab is the preferred method of management for younger patients  \n \nSurgical reduction is reserved for intra -articular fractures and if there is any  intraarticular  \nincongruity. Since there was no mention of this in the question, open  reduction and \ninternal fixation is the wrong choice."

She should be referred on to orthopaedics in the hospital for \nfurther management which would involve joint aspiration and empirical intravenous \nantibiotics.  In a patient presenting with acute monoarthritis, septic arthritis is the most \ncommon diagnosis to exclude as if not treated will result to permanent damage and \neven de ath in some patients.  \n \nThe distractor here is reactive arthritis however unlike septic arthritis, fever is not a \ntypical feature of reactive arthritis.  Furthermore, reactive arthritis is more rare a disease \ncompared to septic arthritis and it is typically  seen in young adults.  The stem would \nneed to include more information for one to pick reactive arthritis wuch as skin or eye \nmanifestations or a recent genitourinary or gastrointestinal infection.  \n Bursitis tends to result in tenderness and swelling loca lized to small area with pain on \npassive movement only felt in certain directions.  \n \nGout would be another differential however it is not in the options.

Sclerotic patches represent \nPaget\u2019s disease (osteitis deformans) whereas if it was lytic lesions on the skull it would \nrepresent multiple myeloma.  Alkaline phosphatase is seen to be raised in both Paget\u2019s \ndisease and multiple myeloma however it is usually seen raised in multiple myeloma \nonly when associated with fractures.  \n \nNote tha t there are two types of Paget\u2019s disease:  \n1.

Paget\u2019s disease of the breast  \n \nPaget's disease (osteitis deformans)  \nThink of Paget\u2019s disease as a bone -making process (bone turnover) becoming faster \nand out of cont rol.

			"explanation": "This question can be tricky if we see the age and the X -ray findings of the patient which \nshows degenerative chagnes at the age of 48.  In a 48 year o ld, osteoarthritis may be \npresent coincidentally.  However, the pain seen in osteoarthritis is typically made worse \nby prolonged activity and relieved by rest, and not on lying down which is the first hint \nthat there is possibly more to ti than just osteoa rthritis. One should always be \nconsidering metastasis when there is a history of breast cancer.  \n \nBone scintigraphy is a type of nuclear medicine imaging technique which would be \nhelpful in looking specifically at bone metastasis.  \n \nDEXA scan is not the righ t option.  It is a bone density scan and is used to measure \nbone loss mainly in patients with suspected osteoporosis.  \n \nSerum calcium levels are also performed in suspected bone metastasis because, in \nbone metastases, calcium can be released into the bloods tream leading to \nhypercalcemia.  However, there is a difference between \u201cSINGLE most appropriate investigation\u201d and \u201cSINGLE most initial investigation\u201d.  Serum calcium would be the \nmost initial investigation but not the most appropriate unless of course th is patient were \nto portray signs and symptoms of hypercalcaemia.  \n \nSkeletal survey is useful for multiple myeloma where tumours are seen as \u201cpunched \nout\u201d lesions.  It is inappropriate for this case.  \n \nWhat if an MRI scan was one of the options?  \nAn MRI scan is considered the gold standard for detecting metastatic spinal cord \ncompressions and NICE recommends this should be performed within 7 days if there is \npain alone or within 24 hours if there is pain and neurological signs.  MRI scans are a \nbetter modality for bone metastasis than scintigraphy, however, there is a great cost to it \nif a full body MRI would be required.  For targeted focal lesions, an MRI can be useful if \nperformed at the site of metastatic disease but since this patient has shoul der and spine \ninvolvement without neurological abnormalities, a nucleaer scan would be a better \nchoice.  \n \nIf there were neurological symptoms (e.g. limb weakness, radicular pain, difficulty in \nwalking, sensory loss or bladder or bowel dysfunction), suspect metastatic spinal cord \ncompression and perform an urgent MRI of the whole spine."

These surgical options  \ninclude intrame dullary nailing and compression plating.  \n \nIt is important to remember the key phrases for nerve damage during PLAB. There are  \ncertain phrases you need to memorise to relate it to a specific nerve damages.  \n \nExamples:  \nWrist drop \u2192 Radial nerve  \nFoot drop \u2192 Ei ther common peroneal nerve or sciatic nerve  \nClaw hand \u2192 Ulnar nerve  \nParaesthesia of thumb, index and middle finger \u2192 Median nerve  \nNumbness on superior aspect of upper arm just below shoulder joint \u2192 Axillary \nnerve  \nFibular neck fracture \u2192 Common peroneal ne rve \nFemur neck fracture or Acetabular fractures \u2192 Sciatic nerve  \nFracture of humeral shaft \u2192 Likely Radial nerve  \nFracture of humeral neck \u2192 Likely Axillary nerve  \nMonteggia fracture \u2192 Radial nerve  \nParaesthesia and impaired sensation in both hands (glove dist ribution ) \u2192 \nPeripheral  neuropathy"

The typical patient is a  \nchubby boy, around age 13. They complain of groin (or knee) pain and are noted to be  \nlimping.  \n \nIt is caused by the displacement of the femoral epiphysis (growth plate) in relation to  the \nfemoral neck.

The paramedics reported obvious deformities of his bilateral \nlower extremities.  He arrived at Accident & Emergency in pain but with normal \nvitals.

			"e": "Intra -abdominal bleeding",

			"explanation": "The differential in the polytrauma patient with a sudden change in the level of \nconsciousness is broad.  In this particulare patient, the history of long bone fractures, \nsudden hypoxaemic respiratory failure and focal neurological findings suggests a \nspeci fic aetiology: fat embolism syndrom e.   \n \nWhile it is true that pulmonary embolism in this patient is a distinct possibility since he \nhas just had surgery, it is unlikely in this scenario.  By giving you a history of a femur \nfracture, the examiners are poi nting you toward fat embolism as an answer.  If the \nexaminers had wanted you to choose pulmonary embolism as an answer, they would \nnot have included the history of the femur fracture.  \n \nAlthough atelectasis presents with low oxygen saturation, increased hea rt rate and \nbreathlessness in the history points more towards a fat embolism.  \n \nThe patient is having a respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilating.  Eventually, if not \nintubated, the patient would become acidotic.  \n \nFat embolism syndrome is associated with long bone fractures of the lower extremities, \nusually the femur.  Another group of patients that fat embolism syndrome is commonly \nseen in are those with pelvic fractures.  They typically occur between 24 to 72 hours \npost fracture.  \n \nFat emb olism syndrome is a clinical diagnosis.  Imaging is important to rule out other \ncauses of the symptoms however the diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome can be made \nwith the classic triad of hypoxaemia, neurologic deficits, and the petechial rash \n(especially in axilla) occurs in an appropriate clinical setting.  Petechial rash may not \nalways be present like in this stem as only less than half of them have petechial rashes.  \n \nThe take home points to remember are the clinical manifestations of hypoxaemia and \nneurological impairment in the absence of other pathologies especially with a history of \nlong bone or pelvic fractures.  \n \nTreatment for fat embolism is largely supportive while it resolves spontaneously."

There is \nan association between Achilles tendon rupture and thromboembolism and these \npatietns are usually sent home with low molecular weight heparin for prophylaxis.  The \nrisk of thromboembol ism occurs because he is immobile however in this case, he has \nnot developed and we do not suspect a DVT.  \n \nIf an imaging would to take place, it would usually be an X -ray to rule out calcaneus \navulsion fractures or an ultrasound to confirm diagnosis.

			"explanation": "This patient is suffering from a condition called tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis.  In \nthis condition, there is pain where the common extensor tendon arises from the lateral \nepicondyle of the humerus.  The muscle group that is affected are the wrist extensors.  \n Why is the answer not forearm extensors?  \nThe primary condition affects the extensors of the forearm and the specific muscle that \nis affected is the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle.  Although this muscle is located \nin the forearm, its func tion is to extend and abduct the wrist.  Since the question asks for \nwhich muscle group is affected, the answer of wrist extensors is therefore correct.  \n \nThe fact that this person is a painter is a huge clue as the motion of using a paint brush \nor paint ro llers creates stress at the insertions of the extensor muscles which are \nlocated at the lateral epicondyle.  Painters generally lift heavy objects and heavy tools in \na repetitive motin which worsens the symptoms of tennis elbow.  The combination of \ntendern ess at the lateral epicondyle and pain upon resisted wrist extension are \nindicative of a tennis elbow.  \n \nTENNIS ELBOW  \nRemember, tennis elbow does not always have to happen in tennis players and the \nother term for it which is lateral epicondylitis is not str ictly correct either but there are no \nbetter terms to use for this condition.  \n \nTennis elbow is causd by overuse and partial tearing of the extensor digitorum muscles \nwhich typically cause tenderness over its insertion at the lateral epicondyle of the \nhumerus.  \n \n \n \nTennis elbow is developed by doing any form of activity that involves repeatedly twisting \nyour wrist and using your forearm muscles.  Some examples:  \n\u2022 Playing racquet sports  \n\u2022 Using shears while gardening  \n\u2022 Using a paint brush or roller while decora ting \n\u2022 Activities that involve fine, repetitive hand and wrist movements  \n \nExamination would likely reveal tenderness at the lateral epicondyle and pain (again at \nthe lateral epicondyle) on resisted dorsiflexion of the wrist.  \n \nIt is a self limiting condition.  However, it can often last for several weeks or months.  \nThe treatment involves rest to the injured area, cold compress, avoiding activities that \nstrain affected muscles and tendon.  Painkillers such as Paracetamol and NSAIDs may \nhelp ease mild  pain and inflammation.  Other treatments involve physiotherapy."

			"explanation": "Malignant bone tumoursare uncommon in children but the two that you need to know \nare osteosarcoma and Ewing\u2019s sarcoma as these are the 2 most common malignant \nbone tumours affecting children.  \n \nOsteosarcoma arises most often at the end of bones where growth occurs.  It is the \nmost common type of primary bone cancer and it accounts for just over half of \nchildhood bo ne tumours.  Two -thirds of childhood cases occur between 10 to 14 years \nage.  Males are more often affected.  The common sites that are affected in \nosteosarcoma are lower end of femur or upper tibia (60%), upper end of humerus (10%) \nand pelvic bones (10%).   Since the knee is the most commonly affected, in the exam, \nthe stem would always give you a scenario of a teenage boy with pain around the knee.  \nOsteosarcoma is characterised by intermittent, unilateral bone pain that is worse at \nnight.  Sometimes patie nts might present with a sudden, unexplained fracture.  This is \ndue to structural weakness of the affected bone.  There are often no other complaints \nassociated with this type of cancer.  \n \nOne of the main differences between osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma i s that \nsystemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and malaise are generally absent in \nosteosarcoma however they can be present in Ewing sarcoma.  The tumour cells in \nEwing sarcoma produce cytokines which causes a fever.  In reality, the constitutional \nsymptoms and signs of fever, weight loss and malaise are only present in 10 -20% of \npatients with Ewing sarcoma however look out for this in the exam, as if present could \nhelp you select Ewing instead of osteosarcoma as the likely diagnosis.  \n \nTo summarise, t he exam will probably give you a scenario of osteosarcoma.  This will \nusually be a teenage boy who presents with the complaint of knee pain.  If you see this \nscenario in the exam, pick osteosarcoma.  If the patient in the scenario is a teenage boy \ncomplain ing of tiredness, fever and weight loss as well as bone pain, pick Ewing \nsarcoma.  \n \nThe other options here are less likely.  \n \nChondromas are an extremely rare, slow growing type of bone cancer.  They usually \ngrow in the bones of the skull or in the spinal co rd. \n \nChondrosarcoma is a primary bone cancer most often found in adults aged between 30 \nand 60 years old however, it can affect anyone at any age.  It is a cancer of the cartilage \ncells within the bone.  \n \nFibrosarcoma, as the name suggests, is a cancer of f ibroblast cells.  It can involve the \nfemur, tibia and mandible in adults."

			"explanation": "This is a diagnosis of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. This topic in PLAB 1  \noverlaps with toxicity and emergency medicine. This is a typical PLAB 1 stem: there is a  \nchild that accidently ingests an unknown bottle of medications. For TCA overdose, look  \nfor widened QRS, p eaked T waves, hyperkalemia as main clues. Note that in young  \nchildren ( < 5 years) the symptoms would usually be drowsiness, lethargy, and in this \nstem indications of seizure.  In adolescents and adults, you would see more \npredominant signs of hypertension  turning into hypotension and ventricular \ndysrrhythmias along with the widened QRS clue.  \n \nTricyclic antidepressant overdose in Paediatrics  \nPresentation:  \n- Child ingesting an unknown bottle of medication  - Lethargy, drowsy  \n- +/- Coma or seizure  \n- ECG - widened QRS, peaked T waves (indications of hyperkalemia)  \n \nDiagnosis:  \n- Urea, electrolytes, toxicology screen  \n- ECG  \n- Arterial blood gas  \n \nTreatment:  \n- ABCDE protocol  \n- If within 1 hr of ingestion and >4mg/kg - activated charcoal  \n- Sodium bicarbonate  \n- Correct electrolytes if necessary  \n \nTRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANT (TCA) OVERDOSE  \nTricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose should always be considered potentially life -\nthreatening.  They can deteriorate very rapidly sometimes within 1 hour of ingestion.  \n \nClinical features  \n\u2022 Dilated pupils  \n\u2022 Dry mouth  \n\u2022 Dry flushed skin  \n\u2022 Urinary retention  \n\u2022 Drowsiness and altered mental state leading to coma  \n\u2022 Hypotension  \n \nECG monitoring for TCA overdose is essential.  The important ECG finding suggestive \nof TCA poisoning is QRS widen ing (> 100 ms).  Broad complex tachycardias may occur \nwhich are life threatening.  \n \nTwo popular stems in the exam where the answer is likely to be TCA overdose is the \nyoung child that takes his/her grandparents\u2019 medication who later becomes drowsy and \nletha rgic.  Another is an elderly person who has a terminal illness and wants to take \nhis/her own life who comes in the ED having dry and flushed and pupils are dilated.  \nTCA\u2019s are a prescription only medication and so you should think about how the person \nin the stem obtained the medication before you choose an answer."

			"a": "Low dose antibiotic prophylaxis daily",
			"b": "Observation with weekly urinalysis and urine culture",
			"c": "Surgical reimplantation of the ureters",
			"d": "Endoscopic injection of bulking agents",
			"e": "None of the above",
			"answer": "Low dose antibiotic prophylaxis daily",
			"explanation": "This is a diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).  \n \nFor urology questions in paediatrics in this exam, pay particular attention to VUR and  \nurinary tract infections.  \n \nDo not go into details for these question s, just know the basic presentation, diagnosis  \nand management according to current guidelines. Note to have a basic understanding  \nthat the severity of VUR is graded and management is according to the grade. In this  \ncase the child is between grade II to III . Therefore, according to guidelines, she would  \nstart with low dose antibiotic prophylaxis before consideration for surgery.  \n \nVesicoureteral reflux  \nCondition where urine flows retrograde from bladder into  ureters/kidneys  \n \nPresentation  \n\u2022 Most children are asymptomatic  \n\u2022 Increases risk of urinary tract infection \u2192 Thus, symptoms of a UTI:  \no Fever  \no Dysuria  \no Frequent urination  \no Lower abdominal pain  \n \nDiagnosis  \n\u2022 Urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity \u2192 initial investigation  \n\u2022 Renal ultrasound \u2192 initial investigation \u2192 might suggest the presence of VUR if \nureteral dilatation is present  \n\u2022 Micturating cystourethrogram \u2192 gold standard  \n\u2022 Technetium scan (DMSA) \u2192 for parenchymal damage (seen as cortical scars)  \n \nTreatment  \n\u2022 VUR grade I -IV - start with low dose antibiotics prophylaxi s daily (i.e. trimethoprim)  \n\u2022 If above fails and/or parenchymal damage consider surgery - reimplantation of the \nureters  \nThe International Reflux Study has found that children can be managed nonsurgically  \nwith little risk of new or increased renal scarring, provided they are maintained  infection free. Remember, the goal of treatment is to minimize infections, as it is  infections that \ncause renal scarring and not the vesicoureteral reflux. Thus, the  importance of \ncontinuous antibiotic prophylaxis out weighs surgery in most cases. Note  that during \nearly childhood, the kidneys are at higher risk of developing new scars. So it  is \nparticularly important to start parenteral antibiotic treatment for patients with  \nvesicoureteral reflux before febrile breakthr ough infections.  \n \nFor patients with frequent breakthrough infections, definitive surgical or endoscopic  \ncorrection is preferred. Surgical correction should also be considered in patients with  \npersistent high -grade reflux (grades IV/V) or abnormal renal par enchyma."

			"e": "Prescribe bronchodilators",
			"answer": "Refer for chest physiotherapy",
			"explanation": "Cystic fibrosis is often very difficult to manage and usually requires a multidisciplinary \nteam approach.  The physiotherapist helps the patient clear the bronchial secretions by \nphysiotherapy, the paediatrics often have to prescribe antibiotics to treat the chest \ninfection and prescribe pancreatic enzymes su pplements to correct nutritional deficits.  \n \nAll the answers given have a place in the management of cystic fibrosis and the real \nchallenge here is picking which one is the best.  \n \nChest physiotherapy involves techniques to clear the mucous such as postural drainage \nwehre gravity -assisted positions are used to aid drainage.

This would definitely improve this patient\u2019s symptoms o f \ndyspnoea and mucopurulent sputum.  \n \nAlthough oxygen usually forms part of the initial treatment for anyone presenting with \ndyspnoea, it is not the most appropriate management for this patient since his oxygen \nsaturations are normal.  \n \nAntibiotics are indic ated in patients with cystic fibrosis only in an acute exacerbation of \nthe disease or as prophylaxis in childhood.  The prophylactic antibiotic to offer is \nflucloxacillin as it works well against respiratory Staphylococcus aureus infection for \nchildren wit h cystic fibrosis.  It is offered from the point of diagnosis up to age 3, and \nconsider continuing up to 6 years of age.  If a mild exacerbation is present, antibiotics \ncan be prescribed for 2 weeks.  \n \nBronchodilators, specifically beta -2 agonists, are indi cated in management of patients \nwith cystic fibrosis but they only benefit some patients who have a reversible component \nof their airway obstruction.  \n \nThe question becomes more difficult to answer because dyspnoea and increased \nsputum production are consid ered early signs of an exacerbation in which case \nbronchodilators, antibiotics and even corticosteroids have a role.

In the UK, \nfollow up care following birth for mothers and newborns are delivered by the community \nmidwives.  They would come to visit the mother and  newbonr at their own homes.  If the \nnewborn remains jaundiced after 14 days (or 21 days for premature babies), they are \nreferred back to the hospital to see a paediatrician who would investigate further to rule \nout other rarer causes of jaundice.  The mos t important reason that investigations need \nto be carried out for infants with jaundice lasting longer than 14 days is to diagnose \nbiliary atresia promptly, as delay in surgical treatment in this group could lead to severe \ncomplications.  A split bilirubin  blood test is usually performed to see the levels of \nconjugated and unconjugated bilirubin.  If hyperbilirubinaemia is unconjugated, the \npaediatric team are usually reassured since biliary atresia would have high levels of \nconjugated bilirubin."

Typically, this includes a bilateral \nanteroposterior and posteroanterior views of arms, forearms, humerus, feet, legs, \nfemur, pelvis, spine and skull.  \n \nOnce the skeletal survey  has been done, t hen think of the child\u2019s protection register and \ninvolve social services.   As a junior doctor you should involve your seniors prior to \nchecking child\u2019s protection  register or involving social services. The chief consideration \nis the treatment and  protectio n of the child, so do not delay treatment of painful or \napparently lifethreatening  problems, whilst awaiting an \u2018expert\u2019.  \n In every hospital system there will be a designated doctor for child protection who  \nshould be available for advice. He or she will ex amine the child and arrange hospital  \nadmission for further investigations (e.g. skeletal survey) as necessary. Social Services  \nand the police may need to be involved.  \n \nBruises  \nChildren naturally sustain bruises during minor incidents as part of \u2018growing up\u2019.   \nBruising over the knees and shins is a normal finding in children, particularly toddlers,  \nwho are also prone to sustaining injuries to their foreheads and chins as a result of falls.   \nAs well as considering the possibility of NAI, remember that bruising may occur as part  \nof an unusual pathological disease process (eg Henoch \u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura,  \nhaemophilia, ITP, leukaemia, and other causes of thrombocytopenia).  \n \nThe following bruises should prompt consideration of NAI:  \n- Bruising in u nusual sites (eg medial aspect of upper arms or thighs)  \n- Finger \u2018imprinting\u2019 (eg grip complexes around upper limbs or slap marks)  \n- Imprints or marks from other objects (eg belt, stick)  \n \nConsider NAI in the following fractures  \n- Multiple fractures of diff erent ages  \n- Rib and spinal fractures  \n- Fractures in infants who are not independently mobile  \n- Long bone fractures in children  \n \nThere are a few rare bone diseases that may mimic NAI.

			"explanation": "This young boy has 5 out of 5 of the diagnostic features of Kawasaki disease with a \nfever above 39 C for more than 5 days.  It is important to realise that in its early stages, Kawasaki disease can mimic a viral exanthem and so it is often diagnosed as a v iral \nrash and children are sent home.  \n \nKawasaki disease and scarlet fever have many similarities such as rash, fever, \nstrawberry tongue (which was not mentioned in the stem), and cervical \nlymphadenopathy however the primary complaint of scarlet fever is us ually the sore \nthroat.  \n \nKAWASAKI DISEASE  \nKawasaki disease is a febrile systemic vasculitis that predominantly affects children \nunder 5 years of age.   \n \nThe disease is more common in Japanese children hence the Japanese name \n\u201cKawasaki\u201d of whom described the  disease in 1967.  \n \nDiagnosis  \nThe diagnosis is made by clinical findings alone.  Fever above 39 C for more than 5 \ndays and at least 4 of the following features are diagnostic.  \n\u2022 Conjunctivitis  \n\u2022 Polymorphous rash  \n\u2022 Extremity changes: Erythema of palms and soles t hat later leads to desquamation  \n\u2022 Mucous membrane changes: Red, fissured lips, strawberry tongue  \n\u2022 Cervical lymphadenopathy  \n \nPrompt recognition is important as aneurysms of the coronary arteries are potentially \ndevastating complications and treatment with immu noglobulins reduces their incidence.  \nThese coronary arteries are affected in around 30 percent of children within the first 6 \nweeks of illness.  Hence, an echocardiogram would be an important investigation during \nthe child\u2019s stay in the hospital.  \n \n \nBilatera, non -exudative conjunctival injection  \n \n \nStrawberry tongue and bright red, swollen lips with vertical cracking and bleeding  \n \n \nDesquamatikon of the fingers  \n \nManagement  \n\u2022 High dose aspirin \u2013 Reduces risk of thrombosis  \no Once fever subsides and inflammatory markers fall, low dose aspirin is given \nuntil echocardiogram is performed at 6 weeks to exclude aneurysm  \n\u2022 Intravenous immunoglobulin \u2013 If given within first 10 days, reduces the risk of \ncoronary artery aneurysms"

The mother describes an uneventful p regnancy with her son being \ndelivered via elective Cesarean section at 39 weeks of gestation.  What is the \nSINGLE most appropriate next step in management?",
			"a": "Start weaning from milk and introduce semi -solids",

			"c": "Blood test for cow\u2019s milk protein antibody",
			"d": "Ask the mother to switch to soy milk formula",
			"e": "Change to hypoallergenic formula",

We would normally expect improvements of \nsymptoms in 2 weeks.  If symptom s still persiist whilst using extensively hydrolysed \nformula, then swap to an amino acid formula.  \n \nNot gaining weight and reflux is seen more in Non -IgE mediated rections and thus this \nstem represents a classic scenario of a non -IgE mediated reaction and t rying \nhypoallergenic formulas would be appropriate.  \n \nKey points to remember for exam purposes:  \nIf cow\u2019s milk allergy is suspected and reaction is acute \u2013 Think IgE -mediated  \nIf cow\u2019s mil allergy is suspected and reaction is delayed (reflux, loose stools, tapering of \ngrowth) \u2013 Think non -IgE-mediated"

			"c": "Non-accidental injury",
			"d": "Malnutrition",
			"e": "Osteogenesis imperfecta",
			"answer": "Non-accidental injury",
			"explanation": "This is a probable non -accidental injury. This infant weighs 4.1kg. For a 4 month old  \ninfant this is beneath the normal weight gain line. A female infant of 4 months should  \nweigh about 6.1kg and a male infant of 4 months should weigh about 6.8kg. Another  \nclue to the diagnosis of NAI is the multiple bru ises on her lower limbs. This is the most  \ncommon site of NAI in the infant population. It arises from parents or caregivers  gripping \nand pulling the infant by the legs.  \n \nHaemophilia is incorrect because even though haemophilia is a possible diagnosis, it i s \nimprobable. Haemophilia is an X -linked recessive condition and this is a female infant.  \nHaemophilia CAN affect females but it is extremely rare and if they had wanted you to  \npick haemophilia they would have give additional clues such as neonatal bleeding  \nfollowing venipuncture, gastrointestinal hemorrhage or intracranial bleeding.  \n Thrombocytopenia is incorrect because it usually presents following a viral infection in  \nchildren. Although it presents with bruising and petechiae, it is an improbable answer in \nthis question because the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia lies solely on blood testing  \nand blood smear.

			"d": "Antibiotic use has not been show to reduce renal scarring",
			"e": "Surgical correction should be considered in patients with low -grade reflux",
			"answer": "Antibiotic prophylaxis is first line",
			"explanation": "Antibiotic prophylaxis should be given prior to considering surgery. When medical  \nmanagement fails to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections, or if the kidneys show  \nprogressive renal scarring then surgical interventions may be necessary. S urgical  \ncorrections are generally reserved for the higher grade refluxes (not low -grade). The  \nmain idea of antibiotic p rophylaxis is to reduce risk of urinary tract infection and thus \nreduce renal scarring.  \n \nVesicoureteral reflux  \n- Condition where urine fl ows retrograde from bladder into  ureters/kidneys  \n \nPresentation  \n- Most children are asymptomatic  \n- Increases risk of urinary tract infection \u2192 Thus, symptoms of a UTI:  \no Fever  \no Dysuria  \no Frequent urination  \no Lower abdominal pain  \n \nDiagnosis  \n- Urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity \u2192 initial investigation  \n- Renal ultrasound \u2192 initial investigation \u2192 might suggest the presence of  VUR if    ureteral dilatation is present  \n- Micturating cystourethrogram \u2192 gold standard  \n- Technetium scan (DMSA) \u2192 for parenchymal damage (seen as cortical  scars)  \n \nTreatment  \n- VUR grade I -IV - start with low dose antibiotics prophylaxis daily (i.e.  trimethoprim)  \n- If above fails and/or parenchymal damage consider surgery - reimplantation of the  \n  ureters  \n \nThe Internat ional Reflux Study has found that children can be managed nonsurgically  \nwith little risk of new or increased renal scarring, provided they are maintained  infection \nfree. Remember, the goal of treatment is to minimize infections, as it is  infections that \ncause renal scarring and not the vesicoureteral reflux. Thus, the  importance of \ncontinuous antibiotic prophylaxis outweighs surgery in most cases. Note  that during \nearly childhood, the kidneys are at higher risk of developing new scars. So it  is \nparticularly  important to start parenteral antibiotic treatment for patients with  \nvesicoureteral reflux before febrile breakthrough infections.  \n \nFor patients with frequent breakthrough infections, definitive surgical or endoscopic  \ncorrection is preferred. Surgical correction should also be considered in patients with  \npersistent high -grade reflux (grades IV/V) or abnormal renal parenchyma."

			"explanation": "It is particularly important to remember how to calculate breakthrough doses in palliative \ncare for pain relief.  \n \nIf someone is taking PRN morphine regularly for a while, they should have their pain \nrelief reassessed and increased.  In this stem, we all can agree that the re gular oral \nmorphine dose needs to be increased.  \n \nCalculation of the dose to give for breakthrough pain is easy once you understand it.  \nThe dose of normal release morphine for breakthrough pain should be 1/6 of the total \n24 hour morphine dose.  \n \nIn this stem, increasing the oral morphine to 120 mg BD means that the total amount of \nmorphine in 24 hours is 240 mg.  Breakthrough pain dose should be 240 mg/6 which is \n40 mg.  Hence, 40 mg of oral morphine should be prescribed as 4 hourly PRN in \nadditio n to the BD dose of morphine.  \n \nINTERESTING FACT:  \nThis method of using one sixth of the total 24 hour dose as a breakthrough dose is a \ntraditional method.  Now, with the newer modified -release analgesia, some physicians are choosing to use only 10% of the t otal daily regular dose as the as -required \nbreakthrough dose as there is a better balance of analgesia with adverse effects."

Whilst it is true that if  the \npain is stable and oral route is no longer appropriate (e.g. vomiting), fentanyl  patches \nare a good choice however, the pain here is not stable. The pain was well  controlled  with oral oxycodone of which he has now started to vomit out. It is obvious  that he will \nbe in pain again. Fentanyl is a strong opioid. Due to its long half -life, it will  take at least \n12 to 24 hours to achieve therapeutic drug levels and so is only of be nefit in patients \nwith stable pain. If you had given this to the patient, he would be in severe  pain for \nseveral hours while waiting for the therapeutic drug levels to kick in.  \n \nFentanyl patches are usually used in cancer patients who have stable pain who are not  \nable to tolerate oral medication.  \n \nIt is not reasonable to use constipation as an excuse in this example to avoid the use of  \nintravenous morphine.

The area under the curve is \nthe area underneath the graph where plasma concentration of the drug (y) is \nplottedagainst time after drug administration (x) and this is most important when looking \nat these types of questions.  \n \nThe first -pass effect is where the concentration of a drug is reduced before it reaches \nsystemic circulation.  When a drug is administered orally, it travels through t he gut, then \nthrough the portal system and into the liver. The liver metabolises most drugs and toxins \nthat enter the body and only allows a certain fraction to enter systemic circulation.  This \n\u2018first pass\u2019 through the liver reduces the bioavailabilty of the drug in question.  Drugs \nthat are administered via other routes such as the intramuscular, intravenous, and \nsublingual route bypass being metabolised by the liver and soe the bioavailabilty of \nthese drugs are greater.  Simply put, a larger area under t he curve means a greater \ndrug bioavailability and vice -versa. It would make sense that a drug administered orally \nwould have lesser bioavailability than a drug administered intravenously, therefore \nhepatic first pass elimination is the correct answer.  \n \nRenal clearance of the drug does not pertain to this question at all therefore an \nincreased renal clearance of the intravenous drug and a reduced renal clearance of the \nintravenous drug is incorrect.  \n \nBioavailability increases in patients who have liver disea se since the liver is unable to \nmetabolise substances with efficancy therefore reduced hepatic absorption is incorrect.  \n \nIncreased bioavailability of the drug is incorrect since the oral route would have a \ndecrease in bioavailability as compared to the int ravenous route."

In theory, there should be little or no alcohol left \nin the blood of an adult after one hour from drinking one unit. We say \u201cin theory\u201d \nbecause everyone is different.  \n \nCalculating unit s \nFirstly, you would need to understand the basics. ABV is a measure of the amount of \npure alcohol as a percentage of the total voume of liquid in a drink.  For example, a \nwine bottle that says \u201c12% ABV\u201d means 12% of the volume of that drink is pure alcoho l. \n \nYou can now calculate the units based on this formula  \nStrength (ABV) x Volume (ml) / 1000 = Units  \n \nSo in essence, the number of units of alcohol in one litre of a drink can be quickly \ndetermined, as it is the same as the percentage strength of that dri nk.  1 litre of vodka \n(40% ABV) contains 40 units of alcohol.  Since he is drinking half a bottle of vodka that \nwould be 20 units of alcohol.  \n \nA pint is approximately 568 ml.  A pint of standard beer (3.5% ABV) would equate to 2 \nunits of alcohol.   \nMen and women are advised not to drink more than 14 units a week on a regular basis."

			"answer": "Methadone",
			"explanation": "NICE hasproposed that either methadone or buprenorphine can be offered as a first -line \ntreatment for detoxification. Buprenorphine is not amongst the options, so methadone is \nthe answer.  Methadone is an opioid receptor agonist, so it acts similarly to her oin, and \nhence it is used in opioid substitution therapy as part of the detoxification programme.  \nDetoxification can last anywhere from up to four weeks in an inpatient/residential setting \nand up to 12 weeks in the community.  \n \nMETHa DONE  is the METHoD  numb er ONE  to detoxify  \n \nLofexidine can be used for patients who would like a shorter detoxifying period, who \nhave mild or uncertain dependence, and who have decided not to use methadone or buprenorphine to detoxify.  \n \nNaloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist (opposte from methadone which is an opioid \nreceptor agonist) .  Its main use is reversing the effects of opioids in acute opioid \noverdose.  \n \nNaltrexone is an opioid antagonist (like naloxone)  but with a longer half life.

			"answer": "Protection from free radicals",
			"explanation": "When faced with a question of this type, choose the answer that makes the most sense \nin the context of the question.  You already know that a paracetamol overdose causes \nliver damage.  This happens because a meta bolite of paracetamol decreases stores of \nthe antioxidant glutathione.  Decreased stores of glutathione cause liver cells to be \ndamaged by free radicals.  When N -acetylcysteine is given, it is broken down into L -\ncysteine which then gets converted to glutat hione which in turn protects from damage \nfrom free radicals.  \n \nN-acetylcysteine inhibits cytokine NF -kB and not interferon -alpha.  \n \nIt has a minimal effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes.  \n \nN-acetylcysteine causes the breakdown of sulfhydryl bonds.

			"explanation": "The diagnosis here is obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD). Exposure and \nresponseprevention (ERP) is included in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in \ntreatment forthose who present with OCD. The method is predicated on the idea \nthat atherapeutic effect is ach ieved as subjects confront their fears and \ndiscontinue theirescape response. In this case, the patient would be exposed to \nhis feared stimulus,and would refuse to respond with any safety behaviors.  \n \nSSRIs are also a treatment choice for OCD. But as this is  only a mild \nfunctionalimpairment, ERP would be a more appropriate answer. NICE CKS has \nvery specificguidelines for obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD)  \n \nIn the initial treatment of adults with OCD, low intensity psychological \ntreatments(including Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) ) should be \noffered if thepatient's degree of functional impairment is mild and/or the patient \nexpresses apreference for a low intensity approach. Low intensity treatments \ninclude briefindividual or group CBT (including ERP)  \n \nAdults with OCD with mild functional impairment who are unable to engage in \nlowintensity CBT (including ERP), or for whom low intensity treatment has proved \nto beinadequate, should be offered the choice of either a course of an SSRI or \nmoreintensive CBT (i ncluding ERP)."

			"b": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome",
			"c": "Hyperparathyroidism",
			"d": "Hyperthyroidism",
			"e": "Lithium toxicity",
			"answer": "Lithium toxicity",
			"explanation": "Lithium is still used for bipolar disorder and has been proven to be a very \neffective treatment.  In this stem, we see bloods that show hypercalcaemia.  It is \nimportan to remember that lithium toxicity can cause hypercalcaemia.  Medical \nprofessionals who deal with lithium monitoring are trained to look out for side \neffects of lithium toxicity such as severe or coarse hand shaking or tremors, \nblurred vision, abdominal pain with diarrhoea, slurred  speaking, muscle twitching, \nconfusion and muscle weakness.  We can see some of the symptoms here in \nthis stem.  \n \nPatients need regular blood test to monitor lithium levels every 3 months and \nregular liver function test and urea and electrolytes every 6 months.  The dose of \nlithium varies.  For example, lithium carbonate is normally started at doses of 450 \nto 675 mg twice daily and the lithium plasma concentration is checked in a week \nfrom starting.  The doses are then adjusted according to the amount of serum \nlithium concentration.  Blood tests are repeated and again the doses may be \nchanged.  This is done until serum lithium concentration is in an appropriate \nrange.  \n \nWhile there are reports of lithium causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome, the \nsymptoms of this stem do not fit as well.  It is usually associated with pyrexia, \nrigidity and tachycardia of which only pyrexia is seen in this stem.  Neuroleptic \nmalignant syndrome is more commonly associated with antipsychotics.  \n \nHyperparathyroidism is a much mo re common cause of hypercalcaemia when \ncomparing with lithium toxicity however with calcium levels of less than 3, \nsymptoms that are descriebd in this stem (confusion, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, \nabdominal pain) are unlikely.  Furthermore, hypercalcaemia d oes not cause \ncoarse tremors."

An example would be laughing at the death of a loved one or believing \nthat you have super powers while going through a depressive episode.  \n \nMood congruence also describes a psychotic symptom of bipolar disorder, but, in \nthis case, the belief or action are consistent with that person\u2019s mood.

This is probably because beta -blockers are used to \ncontrol physical symptoms and to provide symptomatic relief rathr than a means \nto cure or to prevent panic attacks.  They work well as a short term f ix but they \nshould not be considered mainstay treatment.  In this question, they specifically \nsay \u201cto prevent further episodes\u201d.  Beta blockers will not help prevent further \nepisodes, they only help with the physical symptoms (e.g. palpitations) during the  \nepisode.  \n \n Management for panic disorder  \nThere are really 2 options when it comes to treatment of panic disorder  \n \nPsychological treatment  \n- Has the best evidence for giving longest duration of effect  \n- Involves CBT for 1 to 2 hours a week  \n \nMedications  \n- SSRI (citalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, escitalopram but NOT fluoxetine)  \n- If SSRIs contraindicated or no response after 12 weeks then imipramine or \nclomipramine should be offered.  \n- Do NOT use benzodiazepines  \n \nThe only pharmacological interventi on that should be used in the long term for \npanic disorders is antidepressants.

It is licensed for use in severe depression or in \ncases in which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) do not work.  It is \nnot used first -line due to its many side effects. One of the side effects is it can \nmake you feel sleepy.  This can work as an advantage in this case since the \npatient has difficulty falling asleep.  \n \nLithium is a mood stabiliser.  It is used in the treatment of bipolar disorder.  \n \nSodium valproate is an anti -epileptic.  \n \nElectroconvulsive therapy is a very controversi al mode of treatment.

Electroconvulsive therapy is generally used in cases of se vere \ndepression that are not responding to antidepressants or other treatment.  \n \nDiazepam is used for a variety of different reasons from anxiety to the treatment \nof muscle spasms.  It is not licensed for the treatment of depression however it \ncan be used for short term (less than 2 weeks) in combination with \nantidepressants if the patient has depression with symptoms of anxiety, agitation \nor insomnia.

When he exits his house, \nhe has to check it at least 3 times by pushing the door handle to confirm it \nis locked.  He now wants help as he has been doing this for a couple of \nyears.

			"c": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)",
			"d": "Antipsychotics",
			"e": "Desensitization",
			"answer": "Exposure and response prevention (ERP)",
			"explanation": "The diagnosis here is obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD). Exposure and \nresponse  prevention (ERP) is included in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in \ntreatment for  those who present with OCD. The method is predicated on the idea \nthat a  thera peutic effect is achieved as subjects confront their fears and \ndiscontinue their  escape response. In this case, the patient would be exposed to \nhis feared stimulus  (locking the door just once and coming out of the house) , and \nwould refuse to respond with a ny safety behaviors  (checking the door again) . \n \nSSRIs are also a treatment choice for OCD. But as this is only a mild functional  \nimpairment, ERP would be a more appropriate answer. NICE CKS has very \nspecific  guidelines for obsessive -compulsive disorder (OC D) \n \nIn the initial treatment of adults with OCD, low intensity psychological treatments  \n(including Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) ) should be offered if the  \npatient's degree of functional impairment is mild and/or the patient expresses a  \npreference  for a low intensity approach. Low intensity treatments include brief  \nindividual or group CBT (including ERP)  \n \nAdults with OCD with mild functional impairment who are unable to engage in low  \nintensity CBT (including ERP), or for whom low intensity treatment has proved to \nbe inadequate, should be offered the choice of either a course of an SSRI or \nmore  intensive CBT (including ERP)."

			"question": "A 21 year old man is seen in the Psychiatry clinic with the complaint of \nstrange body movements.  His mother de scribes his body movements as \nunconventional and inappropriate.  They consist of lip -smacking, \nprotrusion of his tongue and quick, shaking movements of his hands and \nfeet.  The patient cannot control these movements.  His past medical \nhistory is significan t for schizophrenia, diagnosed a year ago.  The patient \nstates that he was started on medication for his schizophrenia several \nmonths ag however he does not take his medication regularly as he \nsometimes forgets to take it.  What is the SINGLE best treatmen t for this \npatient\u2019s condition?",
			"a": "Depot haloperidol",

			"c": "Intravenous chlorpromazine",
			"d": "Oral clozapine",
			"e": "Intramuscular fluphenazine",
			"answer": "Depot risperidone",
			"explanation": "The patient has tardive dyskinesia likely caused by his treatment with \nantipsychotic drugs.  A common side effect of long term use of antipsychotic \ndrugs is tardive dyskinesia which is a movement disorder characterised by \ncontinuous involuntary movement of the tongue and lower face.  Patients are \noften unaware of these movements and they are reported by family members like \nin this case, his mother.  \n \nAlthough all antipsychotics have the potential to cause movement disorders, the \natypical antipsychotics (risperidone and olanzapine) are considered to be at \nlower risk of causing tardive dyskinesia than the other antipsychotics  \n \nAlthough clozapine is also an atypical antipsychotic, it is less preferable to \nrisperidone simply because of the method of delivery.  A depot injection is \npreferred over oral medicatio n in this case since this patient has compliance \nissues.  \n \nHaloperidol is unlicensed for the use of movement disorders but it may be \nconsidered for the treatment of chorea in Huntington\u2019s disease."

			"answer": "Bendroflumethiazide",
			"explanation": "The  key here is to understand what medication can cause both hypokalaemia \nand causes lithium levels to rise.  \n \nThiazides (e.g. bendroflumethiazide) can cause hypokalaemia. Thiazide and \nrelated  diuretics can cause a rapid rise in serum lithium levels leading to toxicity. \nNICE  recommends avoid concurrent use unles s lithium levels can be closely \nmonitored and  the lithium dose adjusted as necessary. Advise patients to report \nlithium adverse  effects (tremor, dysarthria, ataxia, confusion).  \n \nAtenolol \u2192 Is a beta blocker. There has been one study which suggests that \natenolol  might decrease the clearance of lithium. However, NICE guidelines state \nthat no  particular precautions are warranted. Thus being less likely the cause of \nlithium  toxicity.  \n Ranitidine \u2192 is an H2 histamine receptor antagonist that works by blocking  \nhistamine. It is used in gastro oesophageal reflux disease and is not a  \nantihypertensive  \n \nCaptopril and Ramipril \u2192 are an ACEi. They would cause hyperkalaemia.

			"answer": "Tardive dyskinesia",
			"explanation": "Tardive dyskinesia occurs especially in patients with long -term treatments with \nantipsychotic agents. The word \u201ctardive\u201d means delayed, and \u201cdyskinesia\u201d means \nabnormal movement.  Put together \u201ctardive dyskinesia\u201d refers to the delay \nbetween the first use o f offending medication and the onset of abnormal \nmovements.  It takes several months to years to develop the symptoms of tardive \ndyskinesia from the use of antipsychotics.   \n \nIt is characterized by continuous involuntry movement of the tongue and lower \nface.  The disorder can also affect the fingers, arms and legs causing either \nrapid, jerking movements or slow, writhing movements.  \n \nHuntington\u2019s disease usually presents at an earlier age with tremors and \nchoreiform movements.  \n \nParkinsonism can also be cause d by antipsychotic medications however it is \ncharacterised by resting tremors, rigidity and bradykinesia.  The onset of \nparkinsonism as an extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotics usually occurs \nafter 1 week of administration of the offending antipsych otic drug.  \n \nAkathisia like tardive dyskinesia and Parkinson\u2019s can be caused by the use of \nantipsychotic medications but the symptoms involve motor restlessness.  These \nare restlessness of the lower limbs where the patient would have the urge to \nmove. The word \u201cakathisia\u201d is derived from Greek and it means \u201cnot to sit still\u201d.  \nPatients would be seen pacing constantly, rocking back and forth or constantly \ncrossing and uncrossing legs.  The symptoms usually occur after a month of \ninitiating the offending anti psychotic drug."

			"e": "Oral amoxicilin",
			"answer": "Non-invasive ventilation",
			"explanation": "This question is testing your knowledge on the management of acute \nexacerbation ofCOPD. The reason that this is likely COPD instead of asthma is \nbecause of his age, thefact that he is a smoker, and the choice of admin istering \n24% of oxygen rather than100% oxygen. 24% of oxygen gives the clue that he is \non controlled O2 therapy with theattempt to maintain saturations between 88% \nand 92% to balance hypoxia, hypercapniaand pH which is seen as part of the \nmanagement for CO PD. \n \nNon-invasive ventilation would be the next step in management as it is \nparticularlyeffective in supporting patients during an exacerbation especially \nwhen maximal medicaltreatment has not been effective like in this case. Its use is \nappropriate for co nsciouspatients with ongoing respiratory acidosis (< pH 7.35).  \n \nNote that oral antibiotics should ONLY be given if there is purulent sputum or \nclinicalsigns of pneumonia. While it is common practice for all patients with an \nexacerbation ofCOPD to receive a ntibiotics in the hospital, it is not according to \nNICE guidelines and forthe purpose of this exam, antibiotics should not be \nadministered to manage acuteexacerbation COPD unless we suspect \npneumonia.  \n \nThe reason why invasive mechanical ventilation is an i nappropriate answer is \nthat it hasits own complications such as pneumonia, barotrauma, and failure to \nwean tospontaneous ventilation. Thus, it should not be used unless non -invasive \nventilation failsor is contraindicated such as in scenarios like respirato ry arrest, \nhigh aspiration risk, orimpaired mental status.  \n \nDoxapram is also an incorrect answer. Doxapram is a respiratory stimulant. It is \ngivenintravenously and can be used to drive respiratory rate if respiratory rate \nwas less than20 breaths/minute. In  this case, the respiratory rate is 32 \nbreaths/minute hence there isno problem with the respiratory drive. Its use has \nlargely been replaced by non -invasiveventilation.  \n \nManagement of acute exacerbation of COPD  \n- Antibiotics if sputum is purulent or clinic al signs of pneumonia  \n- Prednisolone 30mg/day for 7 -14 days  \n- Inhaled or nebulized bronchodilators  \n- Controlled O2 therapy 24% via Venturi face mask, with oximetry \u2192 Maintain  \n  saturations between 88% and 92%  \n- IV aminophylline \u2192 Beneficial if the patient is wheezy and has not improvedwith  nebulizers alone  \n- Non-invasive ventilation \u2192 Effective in supporting patients during an   \n  exacerbation when maximal medical treatment has not been shown to be   \n  effective"

A chest X -ray \nduring admission demonstrates streaky and f ibrotic lesions in both lungs.  \nAs his symptoms worsened, the respiratory team performed a diagnostic \nbronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage which results demonstrate \npneumocystis jiroveci cysts.

			"explanation": "The first line treatment for pneumocystis jiroveci is co -trimoxazole \n(trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole).  This can be given by mouth or intravenously.  \n \nAtovaquone is a second -line agent, although it is used only for mild -to-moderate \npneumocystis jiroveci.  \n \nPNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA (PCP) (PNEUMOCYSTIS JIROVECI \nPNEUMONIA)  \nWhilst the organism Pneumocystis carinii is now referred to as Pneumocystis \njiroveci,the term Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is still in common use.  \n \nPneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality \namongimmunocompromised people. It remains a leading AIDS -defining \nopportunistic infectioni n HIV -infected individuals.  \n \nHIV infection is a particularly important risk factor especially if CD4 count < \n200/mm\u00b3thusall patients with a CD4 count < 200/mm\u00b3 should receive PCP \nprophylaxis  \n \nFeatures  \n- Exertional dyspnoea  \n- Gradual onset of dry cough  \n- Fever  \n- Tachypnoea  \n- Chest pain or retrosternal tightness  \n- May be signs of AIDS e.g. Thrush  \n- Chest examination is typically normal  \n \nThink of flu -like symptoms in an immunocompromised patient.  \n \nDesaturation on exercise may suggest the diagnosis in individ uals at risk of PCP \nwithnormal saturations at rest. This is pathognomonic for PCP  so in the \noutpatient setting, it is good practice to monitor oxygenation by pulse oximetry \nafter walking in patients you suspect having PCP . \n \nRemember, there are so many causes of pneumonia. The question writers would \nhave togive you some sort of clue if they would want you to pick PCP. The two \nmajor clues thatthey can give are a HIV patient, and desaturation on exercise.  \n \n \n Investigation  \nSputum often fails to show PCP, br onchoalveolar lavage may be needed \ntodemonstrate PCP. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is the \ndiagnosticinvestigation of choice in non -HIV-infected patients and in patients with \nHIV inwhom induced sputum analysis is non -diagnostic.  \n \nManagement  \n- Co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim -sulfa) remains the first line treatment"

			"b": "Bronchiectasis",
			"c": "Asthma",
			"d": "COPD",

			"answer": "Bronchiectasis",
			"explanation": "The history of smoking here is irrelevant as smoking does not appear to be \nanindependent risk factor but smoking cessation is important as part of the \nmanagement if  \nthe patient does smoke.  \n \nThe persistent cough and copious amount of purulent sputum are symptom s \nofbronchiectasis. Measles is a childhood viral infection that is one of the \naetiologies ofbronchiectasis. Finger clubbing is not a specific sign but has been \nseen in bronchiectasisalthough not very frequently. Inspiratory crepitations and a \nchest -x ray t hat showstramlines give a more specific picture pointing towards \nbronchiectasis. Although theseare not diagnostic, the most probable diagnosis \namong the others is bronchiectasis. Onlya high -resolution computed tomography \n(HRCT) chest would give you the dia gnosis ofbronchiectasis.  \n \nBronchiectasis  \nIs the irreversible abnormal dilatation of of small and medium sized bronchi, \nwithchronic airway inflammation. It is associated with chronic sputum production, \nchroniccough, recurrent acute chest infections, and air flow obstruction.  \n \nAetiology  \nThe disease is caused by chronic inflammation of the airways. It may therefore \nbecaused by a large number of disorders which cause inflammation and \ninfection,particularly conditions that facilitate infections, which therefore t end to \nbe recurrentand more severe and so cause damage to the lungs. In general, the \naetiology is either aone -off infectious insult or an underlying immune deficiency.  \nPost-infection : childhood respiratory viral infections (measles, pertussis,influenza, \nrespiratory syncytial virus), tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia.Infection is the \nmost common cause of bronchiectasis  \nImmunodeficiency: HIV infection. Always consider this as a cause in all \nages,particularly if there have been serious, persistent or recurrent infections  \nConnective tissue diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, Sj   \u0650gren's \nsyndrome,systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Ehlers -\nDanlos syndrome,Marfan's syndrome  \nToxic insults: Gastric aspiration, inhalation of toxic gases  \nCongenital defec ts:The most important one being cystic fibrosis  \n \nBronchial obstruction and bronchopneumonia are more likely to cause a \nfocalbronchiectasis, whereas the other causes are more likely to result in diffuse \ndisease.  \n \nAll conditions cause dilation of the airways (due to continued inflammation \ndestroyingtheir elastic and muscular structure) followed by poor mucus \nclearance, and bacterialcolonisation of collected mucus. This then can progress, \nas chronic infection causesfurther inflammation in a cyclical fas hion.  \n \nNote  \n- The most important cause to exclude is CF. Even relatively mild bronchiectasis  \ndiagnosed in middle age can be due to CF  \n- In the PLAB examination, look out for a history of recurrent pneumonias in the  \nquestion  Clinical features  \n- Persistent cough with purulent copious sputum production  \n- Nonspecific respiratory symptoms including dyspnoea, chest pain \nandhaemoptysis.  \nBronchiectasis may progress to respiratory failure and corpulmonale  \n- Coarse crackles are the most common finding, h eard in early inspiration \nandoften in  \nthe lower zones  \n- Large airway rhonchi (low -pitched snore -like sounds)  \n- Wheeze may be present  \n- Clubbing is found infrequently  \n \nDiagnosis  \n- Usually made clinically, with high -resolution computed tomography (HRCT) \nchestfor  \nconfirmation.  \n- A baseline chest x -ray should be done in all patients. Early chest x -ray \nfindingsmay be  \nnormal in patients with bronchiectasis. Chest x -ray in advanced casesmay show \n1 to 2  \ncm cysts, crowding of the bronchi (tramlines) or ring opac ities.The main value of \na  \n  CXR is excluding other causes of symptoms.  \n \nTreatment  \nDamaged lung cannot be repaired and so the basis of management is to prevent \nor atleast slow down further deterioration.  \n- Bronchodilators, chest physical therapy, and postural drainage are used \ntocontrol and  \nimprove drainage of bronchial secretions  \n- If the patient smokes this must be stopped  \n- Immunisation against influenza and pneumococcus  \n- Long -term oral antibiotics fo r patients having three or more exacerbations \nperyear  \nrequiring antibiotic therapy or patients with fewer exacerbations that arecausing  \nsignificant morbidity should be considered for long -term antibiotics.Choice will be  \ndictated by sensitivities and loc al microbiology advice fromsputum test results."

When he is \nbreathless, he  also notices tingling around his mouth and he feels light -\nheaded. These episodes  usually go away after a while. An arterial sample \nwas taken for blood gases  during one of the episodes. What is the SINGLE \nmost likely result of the arterial  blood gas (ABG)?  \n \nNormal Values:  \nPa02 > 10 kPa  \nPaCO2 4.7 \u20136 kPa  \npH 7.35 - 7.45 \n \nBicarbonate (HCO3 -) 22-26 mmol/L",

			"answer": "Pa02 = 13.1 kPa, PaCO2 = 2.7 kPa, pH = 7.57, HCO3 - = 25 mmol/l",
			"explanation": "To understand this question, we have to go back to basics.  \n \nFirst, is the patient hypoxic?  \n- the Pa02 >10 kPa is normal  \n \nSecond, is the patient acidaemic (pH <7.35) or alkalaemic (pH >7.45)  \n \nThird, what is the respiratory component: What has happened to the PaCO2?  \n- PaCO2 > 6.0 kPa suggests a respiratory acidosis (or respiratory compensation  \n  for a metabolic alkalosis)  \n- PaCO2 < 4.7 kPa suggests a respiratory alkalosis (or respiratory compensation  \n  for a metabolic acido sis) \n \nFourth, what is the metabolic component: What is the bicarbonate level/base \nexcess?  \n- bicarbonate < 22 mmol/l suggests a metabolic acidosis (or renal compensation   \n  for a respiratory alkalosis)  \n- bicarbonate > 26 mmol/l suggests a metabolic alkalosi s (or renal compensation   \n  for a respiratory acidosis)  \n \nThis patient is suffering from panic attacks.  \n \nIf your answer was A or D, you need to remember that panic attacks usually \nresult in  hyperventilation thus PaO2 is usually normal (Pa02 > 10 kPa).  \n If your answer was C, you need to remember that hyperventilation which is seen \nin panic  attacks usually result in respiratory alkalosis (pH >7.45).  \n \nIf your answer was B, you need to remember that there would be no metabolic  \ncompensation as panic attacks reso lves rapidly.  \n \nPanic attacks key points  \n- result in hyperventilation which causes a respiratory alkalosis  \n- There would be no metabolic compensation as panic attack resolves rapidly.  \n- We would not expect any metabolic compensation as it takes the kidneys days   \n  to conserve acid.  \n- PaO2 would be normal."

As this is an \nearly  complication (hours rather than days), it is likely to be either atelectasis or \npulmonary  embolism. But since there are no other factors pointing towards a \npulmonary embolism  and there is a smo king history, the more likely diagnosis \nhere would be atelectasis.    \nBasal atelectasis is commoner in smokers and following abdominal or trans -\nthoracic  procedures.  \n \nNote that a D -dimer level is unhelpful, as it will be raised by many different intra - \nand post-operative mechanisms. So D -dimers in this scenario would not help you  \ndifferentiate pulmonary embolism from atelectasis. CRP and WCC are also \nlargely  unhelpful, as these are frequently raised post -operatively.  \n \nChest physio will help if the cause is at electasis.  \n Atelectasis  is the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent \ngas \nexchange  \n \nManagement of atelectasis  \nAdequate analgesia to encourage expectoration, nebulized saline, chest \nphysiotherapy,  deep breathing and coughing, postural drainage, incentive \nspirometry.

			"b": "Ciprofloxacin",
			"c": "Cefuroxime",
			"d": "Clarithromycin",
			"e": "Doxycycline",
			"answer": "Doxycycline",
			"explanation": "The best antibiotic to give this specific patient is doxycycline.  Doxycycline can be \nused in lower respiratory tract infections for patients in whom penicillin is \ncontraindicated.  Doxycycline is given as 200 mg PO STAT on the first day and \nthen 100 mg PO OD for the next six days in moderate -to-severe community \nacquired pneumonia.  \n \nClarithromycin is con traindicated with the use of a stain as clarithromycin is \npredicted to increase the exposure of the patient to statins which can cause \nrhabdomyolysis.  In real life, the best thing to do would be to pause the statin (or \ndecrease the dose) for the duration of the antibiotic therapy with the macrolide \nand then re -commence the statin once the seven days of the antibiotic therapy \nhas been given but since the stem does not have this option, the safest drug to \ngive in this patient is doxycycline.  In additin to b eing contraindicated with statins, \nit also needs to be used in caution with salbutamol as it can cause hypokalaemia.  \n \nCo-amoxiclave is amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.  You should not give a penicillin \nbased drug in a penicillin allergic patient.  \n \nCiproflo xacin is rarely given in community acquired pneumonias except in rare \noccasions of atypical pneumonias.  \n \nCephalosporins such as cefuroxime should not be used in patients with a \nhypersensitivity to penicillin because around 10% percentage of patietns who ar e \nallergic to penicillin are also allergic to cephalosporins.  \n \nAntibiotic policies differ between Trusts.  Always check your local antibiotic policy \nbefore prescribing antibiotics."

			"c": "Continue 100% oxygen",
			"d": "Bronchodilators",
			"e": "Non-invasive positive -pressure ventilation (NIPVV)",
			"answer": "Administer 24% oxygen",
			"explanation": "This patient is experiencing an exacerbation of COPD. Giving oxygen would be \nthe first  action.  \n \nThe history of  COPD alone should prompt you to pick 24% oxygen instead of \n100% oxygen. This is  because 100% oxygen will abolish the hypoxic drive and \nworsen hypercapnia. 24 -28% oxygen significantly increases haemoglobin \nsaturation, without risking further  underventilation and a rising pCO 2, which can \ncause coma and death. Remember that  low-concentration oxygen (of 24 -28%) is \nused in patients with chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease (COPD) or any other \nconditions causing underventilation and CO2  retention.  \n \nThe aim of (controlled) oxygen therapy is to raise the PaO2 without worsening \nthe acidosis. Therefore, give oxygen at no more than 28% (via venturi mask, 4 \nL/minute) or  no more than 2 L/minute (via nasal prongs) and aim for oxygen \nsaturation 88 -92% for  patients with a history of COPD until arterial blood gases \n(ABGs) have been checked.   Titrate up the percentage of oxygen administrered \nwith serial ABG sampling until SaO2 of 88 -92%.  If SpO2 is more than 92%, then \nreduce the inhaled oxygen concentration.  \n \nRemember, for COPD patient s, you should be aiming for an SaO2 of 88 -92%, \n(compared  with 94 -98% for most acutely ill patients NOT at risk of hypercapnic \nrespiratory failure).  \n \nWhat mask to use?  \nUse a 28% Venturi mask  \n \nWhat about non -invasive ventilation (NIV)?  \nNIV should be used if PaO2 is falling in spite of treatment.  We do not see that in \nthis stem as only one ABG has been reported."

The stem states that the neck \nveins are engorged.  In haemothorax there is no distension of neck veins or \nraised jugular veno us pressure due to the hypovolaemic state.

			"a": "Asthma",
			"b": "Bronchiectasis",
			"c": "Pulmonary oedema",
			"d": "Pulmonary fibrosis",
			"e": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)",
			"answer": "Pulmonary fibrosis",
			"explanation": "This is a very straightforward questi on but it does test your knowledge of lung \nfunction testing thoroughly.  The pulmonary indices indicate a restrictive lung \ndisease.  The only choice that is a restrictive lung disease is pulmonary fibrosis.  \nAsthma, bronchiectasis, pulmonary oedema and chr onic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease are all obstructive lung diseases.  \n \nPULMONARY FUNCTION TEST  \nTerms:  \n \nTotal lung Capacity (TLC) \u2013 this is the amount of air in the lungs after maximal \ninspiration  \n Residual Volume (RV) \u2013 this is the amount of air that remains in the lungs after \nmaximal expiration  \n \nVital Capacity (VC) \u2013 this is the amount of air that is pushed out of the lungs after \nmaximal expiration  \n \nForced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) \u2013 this is the amount of air that is \npushed out of the lungs  in one second during maximal expiration  \n \nForced Vital Capacity (FVC) \u2013 this is the amount of air that is pushed out of the \nlungs after forced maximal expiration  \n \nThe following table illustrates the three main values that you need to know for the \nexam and how each pulmonary index differs between obstructive and restrictive \nprocesses  \n \n Obstructive  Restrictive  \nFEV1  \u2193 \nLess than 80% of \npredicted  \u2193 \nLess than 80% of \npredicted  \nFVC N \nMore than 80% of \npredicted  \u2193 \nLess than 80% of \npredicted  \nFEV1/FVC  \u2193 \nLess than 0.7  N \n0.7-0.8 \n \nOR \n \n\u2191 \nMore than 0.8  \n \nObstructive lung diseases  \nThese are diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis.  They \ncause airway resistance to expiratory flow and so result in obstructed airways.  \nWhen expiratory flow is obstructed, the patient will struggle to breathe air out and \nthus FEV1 will decrease.  Because FEV1 is the numerator of the FEV1/FVC \nratio, any obstructive disease will also cause a decrease in the FEV1/FVC ratio.  \n \nRestrictive lung diseases  \nThese are disea ses such as pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung disease.  They \nmay also be caused by obesity, chest or spine deformities and neuromuscular \ndisorders.  Restrictive lung diseases restrict lung expansion and cause a \ndecrease in the amount of air that the lung can hold i.e., a decrease in the vital \ncapacity of the lung.  This results in a decreased FVC.  Because the pathology of \nrestrictive lung diseases also causes a decrease in lung elasticity, it also \nbecomes harder for the lungs to force out air.  This causes a decrease in the \nFEV1.  Because both the FEV1 and FVC decrease in restrictive lung disease, the \nFEV1/FVC ratio remains the same."

			"c": "Discharge with oral cefuroxime",
			"d": "Discharge with oral clarithromycin",
			"e": "Discharge with oral amoxicillin",
			"answer": "Discharge with oral clarithromycin",
			"explanation": "Amoxicillin and co -amoxiclav are a class of penicillins and should not be given to \npenicillin allergic patients.  Cefuroxime (and all cephalosporins) has a cross \nreactivity of around 10% to penicillins.  This means 1 in 10 patients with a \npenicillin allergy, would develop the allergy if taking a cephalosporin.  These \noptions can be crossed out almost immediately with the history of a severe \npenicillin allergy.  \n \nThe next step is to calculate the CURB -65 score to assess the need for hospital \nadmission.  The CURB -65 is a clinical prediction rule that helps predict mortality \nin patients with community -acquired pneumonia.  It consists of 5 risk factors \u2013 \neach scoring one point:  \n\u2022 Confus ion of new onset (AMTS of 8 or less)  \n\u2022 Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) > 19 mg/dL (> 7 mmol/L)  \n\u2022 Respiratory rate \u2265 4- breaths/minute  \n\u2022 Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP \u2264 60 mmHg  \n\u2022 Age \u2265 65 \n \nThe choice of antibiotic to prescribe depends on the severity of the illne ss.

			"e": "Aspirin",
			"answer": "Naproxen",
			"explanation": "This is a classic example of gout which most commonly affects the metatarsal -\nphalangeal joint of the big toe.  Most attacks are sudden can be managed with NSAIDs \nsuch as naproxen.  They are to be continued until 1 to 2 days after the attack has been \nresolved.  \n \nBoth NSAIDs and colchicine re considered first line management in acute gout attacks \nwhich makes this question very difficult to answer.  NSAIDs is generally more often \nprescribed in primary practice for gout and is more tolerable since colchicine is known \nfor its side effects which include diarrhoea and nausea.  So in the exam, if you were \ngiven the choice between the two and the patient is a young adult with no history of \ngastritis or asthma, pick NSAIDs.  \n \nAlways keep in mind that NSAIDs may exacerbate asthma and may worsen gastritis.  \nThey should also not be used in patients with renal insufficiency.  Proton pump \ninhibitors are often prescribed together with NSAIDs for gastric protection especially in \nthe elderly where use of NSAIDs should be with caution.  \n \nAllopurinol is used to prevent recurrence of gout and it is not used to treat acute gout.  \n \nCorticosteroids do have a role in gout that does not respond to NSAIDs or colchicine.  \nThey can be given as a 5 day course of oral tablets, injected into the joint or  injected \nintramuscularly.  \n \nAlthough it is an NSAID, aspirin is not part of the management for gout as it may \nincrease levels of serum uric acid.  \n \nGout  \nGout is a disease that affects middle -aged men and presents most commonly with  \nacutemonoarthritis.  \n \nThe metatarsophalangeal joint of the first toe is commonly affected (podagra), butother \njoints like the knee, ankle, PIPs, or DIPs may be initially involved. The first \nepisodecommonly occurs at night with severe joint pain waking the pa tient from sleep. \nThejoint rapidly becomes warm, red, and tender (it looks exactly like cellulitis). \nWithouttreatment the joint pain goes away spontaneously in 2 weeks.  \n \nCertain events that precipitate gout sometimes precede the attack. Question writersver y \ncommonly give a scenario where a person has consumed excessive amounts ofalcohol \nor started taking diuretics such as thiazide diuretics or furosemide.  \n Diagnosis  \n\u2022 Diagnosis is made by the analysis of synovial fluid  \n\u2022 Serum uric acid during the acute attack may be normal or low.  \no Remember this it is common that questions ask for the diagnostic method for \nacute gout \u2013 serum uric acid should never be the answer for those questions.  \no Serum uric acid level is of no value in the diagnosis of acute urate arthropathy .  \no Uric acid should only be performed 4 to 6 weeks after the acute gout.  \n \nTreatment:  \nAcute management  \n- NSAIDs  \n- intra-articular steroid injection  \n- Colchicine  \n \nChronic hypouricemic therapy:  \n- Allopurinol should not be started until 2 weeks after an acute attack has settledas it  \nmay precipitate a further attack if started too early  \n- NSAID or colchicine cover should be used when starting allopurinol"

New -onset headache in \nanypatient older than 50 year s prompts consideration of this diagnosis, which if \nleftuntreated may result in permanent vision loss.  \n \nThe most common symptoms of giant cell arteritis are headache and pain that \nusuallyoccurs in one or both temples.

It is most commonly caused \nby local spread of infections from the genital  tract (such as Chlamydia \ntrachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae) where there is a retrograde spread from \nthe prostatic urethra and seminal vesicles.  \n \nThe most important diff erential diagnosis is testicular torsion. This needs to be  \nexcluded urgently to prevent ischaemia of the testicle. Epididymo -orchitis has \nsimilar  presenting symptoms as testicular torsion. Tenderness is usually localized \nto the  epididymis (absence of testi cular tenderness may help to distinguish \nepididymo -orchitis  from testicular torsion, but in many cases, it is difficult to \ndistinguish between the two).  \n \nAnother feature that can help distinguish epididymo -orchitis from testicular \ntorsion is that the tende rness may be relieved by elevating the scrotum (positive \nPrehn\u2019s sign) in epididymo -orchitis.

It is suggested that \nsubfertility is due to elevated scrotal temperatures by bloo d pooling which has \nharmful effects on spermatogenesis.  \n Diagnosis  \n\u2022 Scrotal Doppler - USS: is diagnostic  \n \nManagement  \n\u2022 usually conservative  \n\u2022 Occasionally surgery is required if the patient is troubled by pain. There is \nongoing debate regarding the effectiveness of surgery to treat infertility  \n\u2022 In regards to management of infertility, there is still an ongoing debate if \nsurgery is effective.  \n \nAlways consider secondary varicocele which is where there is a pathological \nprocess blocking the flow of the t esticular vein.  One classic example is a tumour \nof the kidney that may involve obstruction of the left testicular vein.  This is one of \nthe very commonly asked questions in exams."

This prevents \nlong waits in A&E for a scan.  \n \nX-rays are s eldom used as an imaging modality for renal stones as it misses \n20% of stones which are not radio -opaque however it is still the most cost -\neffective method in detecting stones.  In UK hospitals, Urologist and A&E doctors \nwould order a CT KUB without even having an X -ray performed.  The reason \nbehind this is that it is much more accurate than an X -ray a nd CT scans are so \nreadily available in this age.  \n \nRenal Ultrasound scan has sensitivity for detecting renal calculi but sensitiviities \nvary.  It is useful for identifying evidence of obstruction by looking for \nhydronephrosis or hydroureter.   \nVASCULAR SURGERY  \nQuestions&Answers"

			"question": "A 55 year old smoker presents to the emergency department with complaint of \nsevere left leg and foot pain that began earlier in the day.  The pain spreads to the \nlevel just above the inguinal ligament.  His past medical history includes \nhypertension.  On examination, he has atrophic skin changes in his left leg and \nhis left limb is cold to touch.  He has no palpable pulses in the left lower \nextremity.  Gross motor and sensory functions were intact in the symp tomatic leg \nand foot.  What is the SINGLE most likely occluded artery?",

			"c": "Aortoiliac artery",
			"d": "Left femoral artery",
			"e": "Left deep femoral artery",
			"answer": "Left common iliac artery",
			"explanation": "The answer here is left common iliac artery.  Femoral artery and deep femoral artery is \nless likely as the pain would start below the inguinal ligament.  The external iliac artery \nbecomes the femoral artery after it passes under the inguinal ligament.  Hence the \nocclusion  would be above the inguinal ligament.  \n \nIf it was a femoro -popliteal artery occlusion, the pain would be described below the \nknee.   \n \nThe option of aortoiliac artery occlusion is not specific as it does not state if it is right or \nleft.  It would also have  symptoms of claudication and pain of the buttocks and thighs.  \nSymptoms of erectile dysfunction can also be seen in aortoiliac artery occlusion.  The \nideal answer would actually be an external iliac artery occlusion as there are no \nsymptoms of gluteal pai n in the stem.  The common iliac bifurcates into internal and \nexternal iliac arteries and since there is no mention of symptoms of internal iliac artery \nobstruction in the stem, an external iliac artery occlusion would actually be the best \noption if it was  given in the exam.  However, since it is not an option given, common \niliac artery occlusion falls into first place as the answer.  \n \nRemember, symptoms of occlusion has to occur distal to the level of the occlusion.   \nLOWER LIMB ARTERIES"

			"question": "A 62 year old male presented to Accident & Emergency with the complaint of \nsudden, severe back pain.  His medical history includes hypertension and type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus.  He was found to be hypotensive with the presence of a \npusatile abdominal mass.  Th e patient was subsequently determined to have an \nexpanding abdominal aortic aneurysm and the decision was taken to immediately \nrush him for emergency surgery.  Unfortunately, he died on his way to theatre \ndue to a ruptured aneurysm.  What is the SINGLE mos t likely underlying cause for \nhis aneurysm?",
			"a": "Mast cell dysfunction",
			"b": "Collagen dysfunction",
			"c": "Atherosclerosis",
			"d": "Elastin abnormality",
			"e": "Inflammation of the aorta",
			"answer": "Atherosclerosis",
			"explanation": "The underlying cause for true aneurysms most often is atherosclerosis -related.  \nAtherosclerosis reduces the elastic recoil in the aortic wall as well as causes \ndegenerative ischaemic changes, which predisposes to aneurysms.  \n \nAneurysms may be associated with infective causes such as mycotic aneurysms while \nother aneurysms may be due to collagen and elastin abnormalities which are found in \nMarfan\u2019s and Ehlers -Danlos syndromes.  Although aneurysms may occur secondary to \nthese, it is not as common as atherosclerosis, especially in view of the history of \nhypertensi on and diabetes mellitus given in this stem."

			"question": "A 51 year old man has cramping pain felt in his calves when he walks up the hill. The pain resolves within a few minutes of resting. This has been ongoing for the past 6 months. On examination, his popliteal and foot pulses are present but weak. There are no ulcers noticeable on his lower limbs. There is no weakness or numbness in his legs. His recent total cholesterol level shows a level of 5.0 mmol/L (normal is < 5 mmol/L). His blood pressure is 138/89 mmHg. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 24.9 kg/m2 . He is a non-smoker. He has no known medical conditions. What is the SINGLE most appropriate advice to give him for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease?",
			"a": "Advice to start a statin",
			"b": "Advice to start an antihypertensive drug",
			"c": "Advice on reducing weight",
			"d": "Advice on low cholesteerol diet",
			"e": "Advice on trial of exercise before recommending a statin",
			"answer": "Advice to start a statin",
			"explanation": "NICE recommends offering sttins without the need for a forrmal risk assessment for all people with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) (which include peripheral artery disease). For secondary prevention atorvastatin 80 mg would be the drug of choice. Cardiovascular disease risk factors such as high blood pressure need to be addressed, however, in this patient, his blood pressure is within the normal range. He would not require any antihypertensive medication at this point. A healthy diet, increased physical activity and losing weight, overweight, should also be recommended. These recommendations should be in combination with statin treatment. It is important NOT to delay statin treatment whilst managing cardiovascular disease risk factors. In any case, his BMI is 24.9 kg/m2 which is in a healthy range. Other important advice for this patient in line with NICE guidelines would be to commence antiplatelet theapy \u2013 clopidogrel 75 mg daily (aspirin 75 mg daily if clopidogrel not tolerated)"
